No. 21762/2017 ( Assistant Commission of Income Tax, Exemptions v. \\nAhmedabad Urban Development Authority ) is taken as the lead matter .  \\n2.  Religious and charitable trusts have existed in one form or the other, tracing \\ntheir origins to the instinct of benevolence, which is part of human nature.  Indian \\nphilanthropy has enriched its cultural heritage, particu larly in catering to the \\neducational, medical, socio -economic, and religious needs of the people. Here its \\nrole has been supplementary to the efforts of the State, which has recognized the \\npublic utility of this impulse, and granted tax exemptions.  Indian income -tax laws \\nhave favoured charities, even granted preferential treatment since 1886. The law, \\nwhile granting exemption to income from religious and charitable  trusts has taken \\neffective measures to minimise misuse of trust funds. As a result, a \\ncharita ble trust loses tax exemption if certain provisions are not complied with, \\nand if its activities  do not fall under Section 10 of the Act . Such trusts also have \\nto apply their income to the charitable  objects within a specified period, maintain \\nproper audited accounts, and invest or utilise funds in a manner so that no benefit \\nis derived by the settlor, trustees, their relatives, or other persons.1  \\n3. The scope and amplitude of the definition “charitable purpose” under the \\nIncome Tax Act, 1961 (hereaf ter “Income Tax Act\" or “the IT Act”) has engaged \\nthe courts’ (including that of this court) attention on myriad occasions. The \\nexpression “not involving the carrying on of any activity for profit”  in the last \\nlimb of the definition [Section 2(15) prior to  amendment by Finance Act, 1983] \\nwas the subject of debate in no less than five judgments of this court (including \\nthat of a five -member bench).  \\n4. In these batch of appeals and special leave petitions, the primary question \\nwhich falls for consideration i s the correct interpretation of the proviso to Section \\n \\n1 Sections 11, 12, 12 -A and 13 of the Income -tax Act, 1961.

To this list, Parliament has, by amendments, \\nadded other categories, such as preservation of environment (including \\nwatersheds, forests, and wildlife) and preservation of monuments or places or \\nobjects of artistic or historic interest, and yoga.

       "'PART I & II  \\n4 \\n I.  The Writ Petition  \\n1 The petitioner, Sukanya Shantha, a journalist,  wrote an article “From \\nSegregation to Labour, Manu’s Caste Law Governs the Indian Prison System”, which \\nwas published on 10 December 2020. The article highlighted caste- based \\ndiscrimination in the prisons in the country. The petitioner has sought directions for \\nrepeal of the offending provisions in State prison manuals.  By an order dated 10 July \\n2024, judgment was reserved.  We have heard a broad diversity of viewpoints from \\nacross India.  Besides counsel for the petitioner and the intervenor, the Additional \\nSolicitor General (ASG) of India  appeared for the Union of India. T he States of \\nJharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Orissa, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh,  and Tamil Nadu appeared through counsel.  \\n \\nII. Submissions  \\n2 Dr. S. Muralidhar, Senior Advocate, appearing for the petitioner highlighted the \\nissue of caste -based discrimination in the prisons in India. It was  argued that various \\nState prison manuals sanction blatantly unconstitutional practices, which are violative \\nof Articles 14, 15, 17, 21, and 23 of the Constitution of India. Ms. Disha Wadekar  \\nreferred to a chart of provisions from different State prison manuals /rules  to highlight \\nvarious forms of discrimination in the prisons. She  highlighted that caste -based \\ndiscrimination  continues to persist in the prisons in the country with respect to: (i) The \\ndivision of manual labour; (ii) Segregation of barracks; and (iii) Provisions that discriminate against prisoners belonging to Denotified tribes and “habitual offenders”.  \\nShe further argued that the Model Prison Manual, 2016 does not address the \\nimpugned provisions related to caste discrimination inside prisons other than the '"

       "'PART XII  \\n78 \\n 128 The Court in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Ram Krishna Balothia216 held that \\nthe offences under PoA Act “constitute a separate class and cannot be compared with \\noffences under the Penal Code”. These offences are “committed to humiliate and subjugate members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes with a view to keeping them in a state of servitude”, and “prevent them from leading a life of dignity and self -\\nrespect”. The Court quoted the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act to highlight that “when members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes assert their rig hts and demand statutory protection, vested interests try to cow them down \\nand terrorise them” if they are on anticipatory bail. For this reason, the Court dismissed a challenge to Section 18 of the PoA Act, which debarred the opportunity to seek anticipat ory bail in respect of offences committed under the Act.  \\n129 In Safai Karamchari Andolan v. Union of India ,\\n217 the Court noted that “the \\npractice of manual scavenging has to be brought to a close”. Making a “member of a \\nScheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe to do manual scavenging or employing or \\npermiting the employment of such member for such purpose” is a criminal offence under the PoA Act.\\n218 The Court took a step further, and held that “entering sewer lines \\nwithout safety gears should be made a crime even in emergency situations”. The Court declared that for a death in sewer lines, “compensation of Rs. 10 lakhs should be given to the family of the deceased”. It was emphasized that “Persons released from manual scavenging should not have to cross hurdles to receive” compensation or rehabilitation “due under the law”.  \\n \\n216 1995 INSC 99  \\n217 2014 (11) SCC 224  \\n218 Section 3(j), Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989  '"

       "\"PART IV  \\n10 \\n “India’s founding fathers and mothers established in \\nthe Constitution both the nation's ideals and the \\ninstitutions and processes for achieving them. The \\nideals were national unity and integrity and a democratic and equitable society. The new society was to be achieved through a social -economic \\nrevolution pursued with a democratic spirit using constitutional, democratic institutions. I later came to \\nthink of unity, social revolution, and democracy as \\nthree strands of a seamless web. The founders \\nbelieved that none of these goals was to be pursued, nor could any be achieved, separately . They were \\nmutually dependent and had to be sought \\ntogether.”\\n20 \\nMarc Galanter noted in this regard:  \\n“Independent India embraced equality as a cardinal \\nvalue against a background of elaborate, valued and \\nclearly perceived inequalities. Her constitutional \\npolicies to offset these proceeded from an awareness of the entrenched and cumulative nature \\nof group inequalities.”\\n21 \\nThe Constitution mandates the replacement of  fundamental wrongs with fundamental \\nrights.22 Through its provisions , it displaced a centuries -old cast e-based hierarchical \\nsocial order  “that did not recognize the principle of individual equality” .23 It negated the \\nideals of social hierarchy. The Constitution  is the embodiment of the aspirations of the \\nmillions of ca ste-oppressed communities, which hop ed for a better future in \\nindependent India.  To summarize , the “Constitution, by its very existence, was a social \\nrevolutionary statement.”24  \\n \\n20 Granville Austin,  The Indian Constitution: Cornerstone of a Nation , Oxford University Press (1966), p.  xi \\n21 Marc Galanter, Law and Society in Modern India, Oxford University Press (1989), 2018 Reprint, p. 185  \\n22 Granville Austin, The Indian Constitution: Cornerstone of a Nation , Oxford University Press (1966), p. x ii \\n23 Granville Austin, Working A Democratic Constitution : The Indian Experience, Oxford University Press (1999) , p. \\n7 \\n24 Granville Austin, The Indian Constitution: Cornerstone of a Nation , Oxford University Press (1966), p. x ii \""
