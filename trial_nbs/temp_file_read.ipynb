Leave grante d in all matters where leave has not already been granted.  \\nC.A. No. 21762/2017 ( Assistant Commission of Income Tax, Exemptions v. \\nAhmedabad Urban Development Authority ) is taken as the lead matter .  \\n2.  Religious and charitable trusts have existed in one form or the other, tracing \\ntheir origins to the instinct of benevolence, which is part of human nature.  Indian \\nphilanthropy has enriched its cultural heritage, particu larly in catering to the \\neducational, medical, socio -economic, and religious needs of the people. Here its \\nrole has been supplementary to the efforts of the State, which has recognized the \\npublic utility of this impulse, and granted tax exemptions.  Indian income -tax laws \\nhave favoured charities, even granted preferential treatment since 1886. The law, \\nwhile granting exemption to income from religious and charitable  trusts has taken \\neffective measures to minimise misuse of trust funds. As a result, a \\ncharita ble trust loses tax exemption if certain provisions are not complied with, \\nand if its activities  do not fall under Section 10 of the Act . Such trusts also have \\nto apply their income to the charitable  objects within a specified period, maintain \\nproper audited accounts, and invest or utilise funds in a manner so that no benefit \\nis derived by the settlor, trustees, their relatives, or other persons.1  \\n3. The scope and amplitude of the definition “charitable purpose” under the \\nIncome Tax Act, 1961 (hereaf ter “Income Tax Act\" or “the IT Act”) has engaged \\nthe courts’ (including that of this court) attention on myriad occasions. The \\nexpression “not involving the carrying on of any activity for profit”  in the last \\nlimb of the definition [Section 2(15) prior to  amendment by Finance Act, 1983] \\nwas the subject of debate in no less than five judgments of this court (including \\nthat of a five -member bench).  \\n4.

It is necessary, \\nat this stage, to notice that the IT Act visualized three kinds of charitable \\npurposes: medical relief, education, and relief for the poor – which are described \\nhereafter as “per se purposes” . To this list, Parliament has, by amendments, \\nadded other categories, such as preservation of environment (including \\nwatersheds, forests, and wildlife) and preservation of monuments or places or \\nobjects of artistic or historic interest, and yoga. The last – or the residual purpose \\nincluded by the definition - is “advancement of any other object of general public \\nutility”  (hereafter referred to as  “GPU category”), which is the subject of \\ninterpretation in the present case.  \\n5. The Director General of Income Tax f or exemptions, Commissioner of \\nIncome Tax (“CIT”) in various states, and other officials of the Income tax \\ndepartment (hereafter compendiously referred to as “the revenue”) have appealed \\nthe decisions of various High Courts, which have held that the carryi ng on of any \\ntrade, commerce , or business, is not a per se bar or disqualification for a GPU \\ncategory charitable trust to claim to be such, precluding its tax -exempt status \\nunder the IT Act.  \\nI.

The old Act defined ‘charitable purpose’ under Section 4(3) - i.e., the \\ndefinition as it stood just prior to the IT Act, 1961 coming into force (thereby \\nreplacing the old Act) - as follows:  \\n“4 (3)  Any income, profits or gains falling within the following classes shall \\nnot be included in the total income of the person receiving them  \\n* * *  \\nIn this sub -section “charitable purpose” includes relief of the poor, \\neducation, medical relief and the advancement of any other object of general \\npublic utility, but not hing contained in clause (i) or clause (ii) shall operate \\nto exempt from the provisions of this Act that part of the income from property \\nheld under a trust or other legal obligation for private religious purposes \\nwhich does not enure for the benefit of th e public.”  \\n \\nThis court had occasion to interpret the meaning of the expression “ advancement \\nof any other object of general public utility” in CIT v.

The then Finance Minister , Mr. Morarji Desai, explained the rationale for \\nthe new definition  on the floor of Lok Sabha:  \\n“The definition of ‘charitable purpose’ in that clause is at presen t so widely \\nworded that it can be taken advantage of even by commercial concerns which, \\nwhile ostensibly serving a public purpose, get fully paid for the benefits \\nprovided by them, namely, the newspaper industry which while running its \\nconcern on commercia l line can claim that by circulating newspapers it was \\nimproving the general knowledge of the public. In order to prevent the misuse \\nof this definition in such cases, the Select Committee felt that the words ‘not \\ninvolving the carrying on of any activity f or profit’ should be added to the \\ndefinition. ”11 \\n \\n11. The first major decision to interpret the new definition was Sole Trustee, \\nLok Shikshana Trust  v. Commissioner of Income Tax12 (hereafter “ Lok Shikshana \\nTrust ”). This court turned down a contention that newspaper business, carried on \\nwith several other objects (which included setting up of educational institutions, \\ndissemination of knowledge to the Kannada speaking public through newspaper, \\netc.) was charitable. The court noticed  the chang ed definition :  \\n“7.…The result thus of the change in the definition is that in order to bring a \\ncase within the fourth category of charitable purpose, it would be necessary \\nto show that (1) the purpose of the trust is the advancement of any other object \\nof general public utility, and (2) the above purpose does not involve the \\ncarrying on of any activity for profit. Both the above conditions must be \\nfulfilled before the purpose of the trust can be held to be charitable purpose.  \\n* * *  \\n9. It is true t hat there are some business activities like mutual insurance and \\nco-operative stores of which profit -making is not an essential ingredient, but \\nthat is so because of a self -imposed and innate restriction on making profit in \\nthe carrying on of that particul ar type of business.  Ordinarily profit motive is \\na normal incidence of business activity and if the activity of a trust consists \\nof carrying on of a business and there are no restrictions on its making profit, \\nthe court would be well justified in assuming in the absence of some indication \\nto the contrary that the object of the trust involves the carrying on of an \\nactivity for profit…….. By the use of the expression ‘profit motive’ it is not \\nintended that profit must in fact be earned.

It held that the term had to be interpreted without qualification.  \\n12. One of the judges - Beg, J, concurred with the majority, but after noticing \\nthat the trust deed did not contain any condition on profit -making, expressed a \\nslightly different view emphasizing that the actual activity  needs to be considered , \\nrather than the  absence or existence of any condition, in the trust deed.  \\n13. The next decision of importance is  Indian Chamber of Commerce v. CIT13. \\nThe appellant -chamber was a company registered under Section 25 of the Indian \\nCompanies Act, 1913. Its memorandum and articles of association stipulated \\ncertain broad objects, which this court agreed fell within the expression “the \\nadvancement of any … object of general public utility”  in Section 2(15) of the \\nAct. The objects were “promotional and protective of Indian trade interests and \\nother allied service operations”.  A residual clause authorised the chamber “to do \\nall other things as may be conducive to the development of trade, commerce and \\nindustries or incidental to attainment of the above objects or any of them”. As \\nper clauses (4) and (8) of the memorandum of association , the chamber’s member \\ncould not stand to gain personally since no portion of  \\n“income and property of the association shall be paid  … directly or \\nindirectly, by way of dividend or bonus or otherwise howsoever by “way of \\nprofit to the persons who at any time are ... members of the Association ....”  \\n \\nOn dissolution of the association , the members could not claim any share in the \\nassets. The chamber, conceded before this court, that it “by and large, strives to \\nadvance the general trade interests of India and Indian without seeking to make \\nprofits for its members.” This court denied the  exemption claimed, holding that:  \\n“14… The attainment of that object shall not involve activities for profit. \\nWhat then is an activity for profit?

We will illustrate to illumine. If there is a restrictive \\nprovision in the bye -laws of the charitable organisation which insists that the \\ncharges levied  for services of public utility rendered are to be on a ‘no profit” \\nbasis, it clearly earns the benefit of Section 2(15). For instance, a funeral \\nhome, an S.P.C.A. or a cooperative may render services to the public but \\nwrite a condition into its constituti on that it shall not charge more than is \\nactually needed for the rendering of the services, — maybe it may not be an \\nexact equivalent, such mathematical precision being impossible in the case of \\nvariables, — maybe a little surplus is left over at the end o f the year — the \\nbroad inhibition against making profit is a good guarantee that the carrying \\non of the activity is not  for profit. As an antithesis, take a funeral home or an \\nanimal welfare organisation or a super bazaar run for general public utility \\nby an institution which charges large sums and makes huge profits. \\nIndubitably they render services of general public utility. Their objects are \\ncharitable but their activities are for profit … \\n            **********  \\n16. To sum up, Section 2(15) excludes from exemption the carrying on of \\nactivities for profit even if they are linked with the objectives of general public \\nutility, because the statute interdicts, for purposes of tax relief, the \\nadvancement of such objects by  involvement in the carrying on of activities \\nfor profit. We appreciate the involved language we use, but when legislative \\ndraftsmanship declines to be simple, interpretative complexity becomes a \\njudicial necessity.  \\n**********  \\n21. The true test is to ask f or answers to the following questions: (a) Is the \\nobject of the assessee one of general public utility? (b) Does the advancement \\nof the object involve activities bringing in moneys? (c) If so, are such \\nactivities undertaken (i) for profit or (ii) without p rofit? Even if (a) and (b) \\nare answered affirmatively, if (c)(i) is answered affirmatively, the claim for \\nexemption collapses. The solution to the problem of an activity being \\none for or irrespective of profit is gathered on a footing of facts. What is the  \\nreal nature of the activity? One which is ordinarily carried on by ordinary \\npeople for gain? Is there a built -in prescription in the constitution against \\nmaking a profit? Has there been in practice, profit from this venture? \\nAlthough, this last is a weak test. The mere fact that a service is rendered is \\nno answer to chargeability because all income is often derived by rendering \\nsome service or other.”  \\n \\nC. The judgment in Surat Art Silk  \\n14.

It is the object of general public utility whi ch must not \\ninvolve the carrying on of any activity for profit and not its advancement or \\nattainment.

CIT [(1975) 100 ITR 392 (AC)], in our opinion lay \\ndown the correct interpretation of the last ten words in Section 2 clause(15). \\nThe true meaning o f these last ten words is that when the purpose of a trust \\nor institution is the advancement of an object of general public utility, it is \\nthat object of general public utility and not its accomplishment or carrying \\nout which must not involve the carrying on of any activity for profit.”  \\n \\n16. The court then went on to hold what is meant by “ not involving the carrying \\non an activity for profit” :  \\n“15. …The question that is necessary to be asked for this purpose is as to \\nwhen can the purpose of a trust or institution be said to involve the carrying \\non of any activity for profit. The word “involve” according to the  Shorter \\nOxford Dictionary  means “to enwra p in anything, to enfold or envelop; to \\ncontain or imply”. The activity for profit must, therefore, be intertwined or \\nwrapped up with or implied in the purpose of the trust or institution or in \\nother words it must be an integral part of such purpose.

Now there are two possible ways of looking at this \\nproblem of construction. One interpretation is that according to the definition \\nwhat is n ecessary is that the purpose must be of such a nature that it involves \\nthe carrying on of any activity for profit in the sense that it cannot be achieved \\nwithout carrying on an activity for profit. On this view, if the purpose can be \\nachieved without the t rust or institution engaging itself in an activity for \\nprofit, it cannot be said that the purpose involves the carrying on of an activity \\nfor profit…  \\n******************      **************  \\n16. The other interpretation is to see whether the purpose of the t rust or \\ninstitution in fact involves the carrying on of an activity for profit or in other \\nwords whether an activity for profit is actually carried on as an integral part \\nof the purpose or to use the words of Chandrachud, J, as he then was \\nin Dharmodayam c ase [(1977) 4 SCC 75] , “as a matter of advancement of \\nthe purpose”. There must be an activity for profit and it must be involved in \\ncarrying out the purpose of the trust or institution or to put it differently, it \\nmust be carried on in order to advance th e purpose or in the course of \\ncarrying out the purpose of the trust or institution. It is then that the inhibition \\nof the exclusionary clause would be attracted. This appears to us to be a more \\nplausible construction which gives meaning and effect to the l ast concluding \\nwords added by the legislature and we prefer to accept it. Of course, there is \\none qualification which must be mentioned here and it is that if the \\nconstitution of a trust or institution expressly provides that the purpose shall \\nbe carried o ut by engaging in an activity which has a predominant profit \\nmotive, as, for example, where the purpose is specifically stated to be \\npromotion of sports by holding cricket matches on commercial lines with a \\nview to making profit, there would be no scope fo r controversy, because the \\npurpose would, on the face of it, involve carrying on of an activity for profit \\nand it would be non -charitable even though no activity for profit is actually \\ncarried on or, in the example given, no cricket matches are in fact org anised.  \\n17. The next question that arises is as to what is the meaning of the \\nexpression “activity for profit”. Every trust or institution must have a purpose \\nfor which it is established and every purpose must for its accomplishment \\ninvolve the carrying on  of an activity. The activity must, however, be for profit \\nin order to attract the exclusionary clause and the question therefore is when \\ncan an activity be said to be one  for profit? The answer to the question \\nobviously depends on the correct connotation of the preposition “for”. This \\npreposition has many shades of meaning but when used with the active \\nparticiple of a verb it means “for the purpose of” and connotes the end with \\nreference to which something is done. It is not therefore enough that as a \\nmatter of fact an activity results in profit but it must be carried on with the \\nobject of earning profit. Profit -making must be the end to which the activity \\nmust be directed or in other words, the predominant object of the activity must \\nbe making a profit. Wh ere an activity is not pervaded by profit motive but is \\ncarried on primarily for serving the charitable purpose, it would not be \\ncorrect to describe it as an activity for profit. But where, on the other hand, \\nan activity is carried on with the predominant object of earning profit, it \\nwould be an activity for profit, though it may be carried on in advancement \\nof the charitable purpose of the trust or institution.

The court took note of the judgment of Pathak, J. in  Dharmadeepti  v. CIT17  \\nas well as the speech of then then Finance Minister, and further observed:   \\n“17. ….It is obvious that the exclusionary clause was added with a view to \\novercoming the decision of the Privy Council in the  Tribune case  [AIR 1939 \\nPC 208: In Re the T rustees of the Tribune, (1939) 7 ITR 415] where it was \\nheld that the object of supplying the community with an organ of educated \\npublic opinion by publication of a newspaper was an object of general public \\nutility and hence charitable in character, even th ough the activity of \\npublication of the newspaper was carried on commercial lines with the object \\nof earning profit. The publication of the newspaper was an activity engaged \\nin by the trust for the purpose of carrying out its charitable purpose and on \\nthe facts it was clearly an activity which had profit making as its predominant \\nobject, but even so it was held by the Judicial Committee that since the \\npurpose served was an object of general public utility, it was a charitable \\npurpose. It is clear from the s peech of the Finance Minister that it was with a \\nview to setting at naught this decision that the exclusionary clause was added \\nin the definition of “charitable purpose”. The test which has, therefore, now \\nto be applied is whether the predominant object of  the activity involved in \\ncarrying out the object of general public utility is to subserve the charitable \\npurpose or to earn profit. Where profit making is the predominant object of \\nthe activity, the purpose, though an object of general public utility, wou ld \\ncease to be a charitable purpose. But where the predominant object of the \\nactivity is to carry out the charitable purpose and not to earn profit, it would \\nnot lose its character of a charitable purpose merely because some profit \\narises from the activity . The exclusionary clause does not require that the \\nactivity must be carried on in such a manner that it does not result in any \\nprofit. It would indeed be difficult for persons in charge of a trust or \\ninstitution to so carry on the activity that the expend iture balances the income \\nand there is no resulting profit…..  \\n \\n18. The court proceeded to quote from passages in its previous judgments, in \\nLok Shikshana Trust and Indian Chamber of Commerce (supra) to the effect that \\nif the activity of a trust consists of carrying on a business and there are no \\nrestrictions on profit -making, the court could assume (in the absence of \\nsomething to the contrary) that the trust’s object involved carrying on of an  \\n \\n17 (1978) 3 SCC 499  ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The Constitution Bench disagreed with the approach in both \\nthe previous judgments, and observed:  \\n“19. …Now we entirely agree with the learned Judges who decided these two \\ncases that activity involved in carrying out the charitable purpose must not \\nbe motivated by a profit objective but it must be undertaken for the purpose \\nof advancement or carrying out of the charitable purpose. But we find it \\ndifficult to accept their thesis that whenever an activity is carried on which  \\nyields profit, the inference must necessarily be drawn, in the absence of some \\nindication to the contrary, that the activity is  for profit and the charitable \\npurpose involves the carrying on of an activity for profit. We do not think the \\nCourt would be ju stified in drawing any such inference merely because the \\nactivity results in profit. It is in our opinion not at all necessary that there \\nmust be a provision in the constitution of the trust or institution that the \\nactivity shall be carried on no profit no  loss basis or that profit shall be \\nproscribed. Even if there is no such express provision, the nature of the \\ncharitable purpose, the manner in which the activity for advancing the \\ncharitable purpose is being carried on and the surrounding circumstances \\nmay clearly indicate that the activity is not propelled by a dominant profit \\nmotive. What is necessary to be considered is whether having regard to all \\nthe facts and circumstances of the case, the dominant object of the activity is \\nprofit making or carrying out a charitable purpose. If it is the former, the \\npurpose would not be a charitable purpose, but, if it is the latter, the \\ncharitable character of the purpose would not be lost.   \\n20. If we apply this test in the present case, it is clear that the activity  of \\nobtaining licences for import of foreign yarn and quotas for purchase of \\nindigenous yarn, which was carried on by the assessee, was not an activity \\nfor profit. The predominant object of this activity was promotion of commerce \\nand trade in Art Silk Yarn , Raw Silk, Cotton Yarn, Art Silk Cloth, Silk Cloth \\nand Cotton Cloth, which was clearly an object of general public utility and \\nprofit was merely a bye -product which resulted incidentally in the process of \\ncarrying out the charitable purpose. It is signifi cant to note that the assessee \\nwas a Company recognised by the Central Government under Section 25 of \\nthe Companies Act, 1956 and under its Memorandum of Association, the \\nprofit arising from any activity carried on by the assessee was liable to be \\napplied solely and exclusively for the promotion of trade and commerce in \\nvarious commodities which we have mentioned above and no part of such \\nprofit could be distributed amongst the members in any form or under any \\nguise. The profit of the assessee could be util ised only for the purpose of \\nfeeding this charitable purpose and the dominant and real object of the \\nactivity of the assessee being the advancement of the charitable purpose, the \\nmere fact that the activity yielded profit did not alter the charitable chara cter \\nof the assessee. We are of the view that the Tribunal was right in taking the \\nview that the purpose for which the assessee was established was a charitable \\npurpose within the meaning of Section 2 clause (15) and the income of the \\nassessee was exempt f rom tax under Section 11.

He also noted \\nthat “A reading of Section 2(15) and Section 11 together shows that what is \\nfrowned upon is an activity for profit by a charity established for advancement of \\nan object of general public utility in  the course of accomplishing its objects.”  The \\nsame judgment also stated that:  \\n“if the object of the trust is advancement of an object of general public utility and it \\ncarried on any activity for profit, it is excluded from the ambit of charitable purpose \\ndefined in Section 2(15).

The substituted sub -section (4A) states that the income derived from a \\nbusiness held under  Trust wholly for charitable or religious purposes shall \\nnot be included in the total income of the previous year of the Trust or \\ninstitution if \"the business is incidental to the attainment of the objective of \\nthe Trust or, as the case may be, institution \" and separate books of account \\nare maintained in respect of such business. Clearly, the scope of sub -section \\n(4A) is more beneficial to a Trust or institution than was the scope of sub -\\nsection (4A) as originally enacted. In fact, it seems to us that the s ubstituted \\nsub-section (4A) gives Trust or institution a greater benefit than was given by \\nsection 13(1)(bb). If the object of Parliament was to give Trusts and \\ninstitutions no more benefit than that given by section 13(1)(bb), the language \\nof section 13(1 )(bb) would have been employed in the substituted sub -section \\n(4A). As it stands, all that it requires for the business income of a Trust or \\ninstitution to be exempt is that the business should be incidental to the \\nattainment of the objectives of the Trust  or institution. A business whose \\nincome is utilized by the Trust or the institution for the purposes of achieving \\nthe objectives of the Trust or the institution is, surely, a business which is \\nincidental to the attainment of the objectives of the Trust .

Those decisions cons equently did not rule out \\ncarrying on of activities akin to business, by charitable institutions established to \\nadvance general public utility.  \\n29. The ASG next submitted that Parliament’s intent, in changing the law, wa s \\nto expressly forbid  the tax exemption benefit if the entity was “involved” in \\ncarrying on trade or business. The revenue relied on the two decisions in  Lok \\nShikshana Trust , and Indian Chamber of Commerce  (supra) , highlighting that the \\nsignificance of the change – brought about by  Section 2(15) of the IT Act – was \\nnoticed. Particular reliance was placed on the observations of Beg, J in Lok \\nShikshana Trust and the passages in Indian Chamber of Commerce to urge that \\nthe involvement of an entity in the carrying on of activities for pr ofit, even if for \\nadvancement of  charitable purpose or object, disentitl ed it to tax exemption . The \\nlearned ASG urged that this court  had recognized – from its earlier decisions – \\nthat the prohibition from carrying on trade or commerce activities applied o nly to \\ncharities meant to advance general public utility and not the other categories such \\nas education, medical relief , or relief to the poor (which are per se exempt).  \\n30. The ASG submitted that the judgments in Indian Chamber of Commerce \\nand Lok Shiksha na Trust  (supra) were conscious of the generality  of the GPU \\ncategory  which led Parliament to insert the restrictive words \"not involving the \\ncarrying on of any activity for profit ”. It was argued  that Parliament amended  the \\ndefinition due to rampant abuse of the law by businesses  claiming to be driven by \\ncharitable purposes.  Often, charities would be created merely to secure exemption \\nfrom tax, and would carry on large commercial activities, enjoying the profits . \\nThis led Par liament to embed the exclusionary terms, depriving exemption if the \\ninstitution otherwise fell under the GPU category  charity, but undertook activities \\nfor profit.

The Select \\nCommittee of Parliament (at that time), felt that to prevent misuse of the \\ndefinition in such cases, the words “not involving the carrying on of any  activity \\nfor profit” should be added to the definition. ASG relied on Lok Shikshana Trust  \\n(supra) which highlighted that this statement shed light on the new provision.  \\n31. It was submitted that Indian Chamber of Commerce (supra) recognized this \\nlegislative history, and also held that the interpretation of the provision had to be \\nin tune with  the advancement of the object of the changed law. The court also \\nwas conscious that there were borderline cases which posed difficulty in deciding \\nex facie  whether the undertaking yielding profit is a “deceptive”  device or a \\nbonafide  venture resulting “in nominal surplus although substantially intended \\nonly to advance the charitable object” . The court also held that the restrictive \\ncondition was a “term of art and embraces objects of general public utility” . Yet, \\nunder the garb of charitable purposes, orga nisations masking profit, sprang up. \\nThe mask was charitable, but the “heart was hunger for tax free profit” . The \\nrevenue highlighted the following reasoning from this court’s judgment in Indian \\nChamber of Commerce  (supra) : \\n“by the new definition the benef it of exclusion from total income is taken away \\nwhere in accomplishing a charitable purpose the institution engages itself in \\nactivities for profit. The Calcutta decisions are right in linking; activities for \\nprofit with advancement of the object. If you w ant immunity from taxation, \\nyour means of fulfilling charitable purposes must be unsullied by profit \\nmaking ventures.”  \\n \\n32. It was then urged that before the decision in Surat Art Silk (supra) two \\nlegislative developments took place, which reinforced the revenue’s view that \\ncharities cannot engage in commercial activities. The first was the amendment, \\ncarried out in 1975 to the IT Act (w.e.f. 01.04.1976), which introduced Section \\n10 (23C ) and had the effect of excluding income received by inter alia, any fund \\nor institution, established for charitable purposes.

The ASG then contended that the decision in Surat Art Silk (supra)  had the \\nunintended consequence of ignoring the significance of the addition of the \\nexpression “advancement of any other object of genera l public utility not \\ninvolving the carrying on of any activity for profit” . The remedy intended by \\nParliament, in adding the said terms was to prevent charities (involved in the \\ncarrying on of any activity for profit) from claiming exemption, and to ensure that \\npurely  charitable activity -driven trusts or institutions, could claim exemption.

The ASG further submitted that if the history of the provision, and the \\nfurther amendments were kept in mind, the  question of permitting activities that \\nhad any business or trade, for consideration, could not arise; however, by later \\namendments, GPU category charities have been permitted to carry on activities \\nin the nature of business, for consideration, or service in relation to business and \\ncommerce, provided that is in the course of actually achieving the charitable \\nobject, and also that income from such activities (i.e. business, etc .) does not \\nexceed 20% of the total receipts.  \\n36.

However, if \\ntheir activities are akin to or “in the nature of” business, or trade, or they provide \\nservices to businesses or trade, for consideratio n, fee or even cess (since they may \\nbe enabled to do so by law) they have to fulfil the mandate and restrictions under \\nSection 2(15), especially proviso (ii). The ASG cited the larger bench decision in \\nNew Delhi Municipal Council v. State of Punjab25 (here after “ NDMC ”) to urge \\nthat state entities are not exempt from Union taxation, if they engage in trade or \\nbusiness.

Whilst the lion’s shares of properties developed by AUDA were to be \\nallotted for housing and residence, and earmarked specifically for public \\namenities, roads etc., a small percentage (15%) could be sold by public auction. \\nIt was submitted that the statutory model adopted by AUDA was to enable it to \\nfunction as a self -sustaining unit.

The \\nfunctions of this Board were identical to that of A UDA and its mandate is to \\nregulate and develop building activities aimed for the purposes of providing \\nhousing.  \\n39. Learned counsel urged that none of the three boards carry on any business \\nactivity; their functions are controlled by the parent enactments under which they \\nwere created. Furthermore, on advancing of its affairs in such a manner that if \\nany surpluses are generated, they were used for furthering the objectives of law. \\nThus, for instance, if surplus is generated in the activities of AUDA, GIDC , or \\nGHB, those would not be handed to the State Government, which previously had \\ncontrol over them but rather kept in a separate fund to be utilised for further \\ndevelopment, expansion and development activities by each of such corporations. \\nThese cannot be construed as carrying on any trade, business or commerce.  \\n40.

In such cases, the entity is debarred from claiming that it is \\na charity and cannot claim the benefit of tax exemption. Therefore, what is to be \\nunderstood from the rati o in Surat Art Silk (supra) is that the main purpose or \\nprincipal objective or motivation for the activity should not be to carry on trade \\nor business. It should be to advance the purpose of general public utility. If such \\na purpose is fulfilled, the carry ing on of some activity which might result in \\nsurplus, would not  disentitle the entity from the benefit of tax exemption.  \\n41. Learned counsel then made a brief reference to the judgment in CIT, \\nBombay v. Bar Council of Maharashtra29  arguing that Surat Ar t Silk (supra) was \\nfollowed in this decision. He also cited Thant hi Trust (supra) . Counsel \\nhighlighted that the object of the assessee there, was charitable and required that \\nthe business ought to be carried out for the purposes of achieving the charitable \\npurpose. Having regard to the nature of Section 13(1)(bb), which existed for the  \\nrelevant period, the court held that the income which the trust derived was through \\na business and it only fed the charity. In this light, the court rejected the trust’s \\ncontention with respect to the entitlement to claim tax benefit for the first part. \\nCounsel pointedly referred to the observations in paragraph 24 of the said \\ndecision and submitted that the court noticed the difference in language brought \\nabout by the substitution of Section 11(4A) (w.e.f. 01.04.1992). The new \\nprovisions enabled the Trust  to carry on business for it was incidental to the \\nattainment of its activities.  \\n42. Elaborating on Thanthi Trust  further, counsel highlighted  that the scope of \\nthe provision, i.e. Section 11(4A) had been ruled by this court as more beneficial \\nto the trust  or institution,  than had existed previously before its amendment. \\nTherefore, as long as the Trust carried on its activities mainly for charitable \\npurposes - any income derived from incidental trading or business activities, \\n \\n29 (1981) 3 SCC 308  (hereafter “ Bar Council of Maharashtra ”)  ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Learned counsel also relied upon Circular 11/2008 dated 19.12.2008 which \\nhighlighted that whether the activities carried on by an y charitable institutions are \\nin the nature of trade or whether they are essentially charitable is a question of \\nfact. It also spelt out that if an assessee is engaged in any activity, in the nature of \\ntrade, commerce or business or rendering any services in relation to such trade \\netc., it could not claim that its object was charitable.  In such event, “the object of \\ngeneral public utility will only be a means or defence to highlight the true purpose \\nwhich is trade, service or business………….” . It was emphasis ed therefore that \\nthe circular and the speech of the Finance Minister during the budget clearly \\npointed out organisations, trust or entities which were masquerading as charitable \\nbut in reality carrying on business.

In that case, the Court had \\nstressed that the real meaning of all the words used could be understood \\nspecifically by referring to the past history of the legislation and the speech of the \\nmover of the amendment.  \\n46. Learned counsel argued that the expressions “trade”, “business” or \\n“commerce” always mean and have been interpreted to mean activities driven by \\nprofit . In this context, reliance was placed on this court’s decisions in State of \\nPunjab v. Bajaj Electricals Ltd36.; Khoday Distilleries Ltd. v. State of Karnataka37  \\nand State of Gujarat v. M/s.

It was submitted that in all \\ncontexts, the primary meaning of the expression “trade” is “exchange of goods” \\nfor money and connotates that such activity is necessarily or always carried on to \\nearn profit. It was, therefore, argued that Section 2(15) cannot be read in isolation, \\nbut should be construed in the light of the minister’s speech while introducing the \\namendment, and the Circular (i.e. Circular 11/2018).

Ratan Melting and Wire Industries39 to urge that a circular \\ncannot define an ambit of a provision. He highlighted the decision rendered by \\nthe Delhi High Court in Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority v. \\nUnion of India & Ors40, where the assessee’s  activities were held to be not \\n“commercial activity” within the meaning of clause (b) to S.10(46).41 He also \\nrelied on other decisions – of this court, to the same effect, in Kerala State \\nElectricity Board v . Indian Aluminium Co. Ltd.42 and Trustees of th e Port of \\nMadras v . Aminchand Pyarelal and Ors.43. \\n48. Mr. Gulati relied on the GIDC case (supra)  to argue that the word \\n“development” in S.10(20 -A) of the IT Act, 1961 has to be understood in its wide \\nsense. It was urged that development authorities like NOIDA fall under S ection \\n2(15) of the IT Act, 1961 if they satisfy the test in Section 11(7) of t he IT Act, \\n1961. It was contended that Surat Art Silk (supra)  was clear that engagement by \\na trust with a commercial activity is not per se prohibited, as long as its object is \\nthe attainment of an object of general public utility.

It was submitted that in the absence of profit motive, the activity is not \\ntrade, commerce or business  - within the meaning of first proviso to Section 2(15) \\nof the IT  Act, 1961. Reliance was placed upon Khoday Distilleries (supra) , State \\nof Tamil Nadu  v. Board of Trustees of the Port of Madras53 and several other \\ndecisions54. It was argued that wherever it is intended, profit element is wholly \\nexcluded from activity  - reliance was placed on provisions of the Karnataka VAT \\nAct, The Central Goods and Service Tax Act (“CGST Act”) and Section 2(31) of \\nthe IT Act. In the present context, the activities of the Board do not amount to \\n“trade”, “commerce” or “business” and the  first proviso to Section 2(15) is \\nattracted only if the primary/dominant objects are (a) in the nature of trade, \\ncommerce or business; or (b) rendering any service in relation to any trade, \\ncommerce or business.

Regarding the statutory provisions it was submitted that the words “trade, \\ncommerce or business” in the proviso to Section 2(15) of the IT  Act cannot be \\nread in isolation and have to be seen in context of “charitable purpose” and, even \\nafter a series of amendments - from the Finance Act, 2008 to Finance Act, 2015 \\nthere is essentially, no change in the basis of determination of what amounts t o a \\ntrade, commerce or business and therefore the tests as laid down in Surat Art Silk  \\n(supra) still holds the field to interpret these words.  \\n56.

During AY 1991 -92, the Assessing \\nOfficer (“AO”) denied the exemption on the ground that it was carrying on \\nbusiness. That order was eventually set aside by the ITAT which, held that it was \\nentitled to exemption under Section 11  of the Act. Su bsequently, an amendment \\nwas brought to Section 11(4A)  and AEPC had to maintain separate books of \\naccounts. In AY 1992 -93, the AO again denied exemption. On appeal, the issue \\nwas decided in favour of AEPC by the ITAT. The Delhi High Court upheld the \\norder of the ITAT in a judgment80. AEPC received entrance fee and membership \\nfee which, it claimed were exempt on the principle of mutuality. This issue too \\nwas resolved in its favour from the AY 1992 -93 to AY 1997 -98 by the \\njurisdictional High Court. From the a ssessment year 1998 -99 to the assessment \\nyear 2008 -09, the AO accepted the assessee’s claim that income was exempt \\nunder Section 11  of the Act.  \\n69. During AY 2009 -10 and 2010 -11, the AO denied exemption under Section \\n11 on the ground that the newly inserted proviso to Section 2(15) was attracted; \\nand thus the assessee was ineligible for exemption under Section 11. The AO held \\nthat the assessee was ren dering services in relation to trade, commerce business \\nfor consideration and the receipt of which exceeds ₹10 lakhs. The CIT(A) allowed \\nthe assessee’s appeal following the decision of the High Court in its case, and \\nthere being no changes in the facts and  circumstances of the case.

Mr. Harish Salve, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of Saurashtra \\nCricket Association drew attention of this court towards the ambit of Section 4(3) \\nof Income Tax Act, 1922 (i.e., the old Act), as compared to Section 2(15)  of the  \\nIT Act, 1961 which define s ‘charitable purpose’. He also presented the \\nconstruction of Section 11 in light of Thanthi  Trust (supra) . It was emphasized \\nthat the objects of a trust are decisive and every surplus cannot be construed as \\nprofit, as is discusse d in Krishna Warri ar (supra). Profits from trade or business \\narising out of property held under trust for charitable purpose, if ploughed back \\nto the extent of 100% cannot be termed as a commercial activity. This was the \\nprincipal idea in omitting Section1 3(1)(bb) as it was considered as restrictive for \\ncarrying out such activities. It was argued that, substitution of the definition of \\n“charitable purpose” in Section 2(15) by the Finance Act, 2008 has not changed \\nthe law. The words “ in relation to any trade , commerce or business ” and “ for a \\ncess, fee or consideration ” in the proviso to Section 2(15) implies that \\nadvancement of object of  a trust may not involve activities of profit. It was urged \\nthat the amendment appears to have undermined this court’s deci sion in Surat Art \\nSilk (supra).  \\n73.  It was argued that the crucial part of the definition of “charitable purpose” \\nis the word “cess” employed in the proviso. As an explanatory measure, the \\nactivities of promotional councils were taken into consideration - for example \\nSurat Art Silk  supported silk manufacturers. If such activity is for a cess or a fee, \\nthe organization ceases to be charitable. Activities  in the nature  of trade,  \\ncommerce  or business  are not charitable  if they are for a fee or other  \\nconsider ation.

In this regard it was submitted that, in true sense the word “business” \\nimplies profit, however statutory  organizations are excluded from its ambit.

It was also argued that the sport of cricket is a form of education and if it \\nis not considered as a field of education, it is still an object of general public \\nutility. The primary regulating body i.e., the BCCI, promotes sport in the entire \\ncountry and worldwide, and the assessees herein are its second and third tier \\nassociations.  The revenue generated by BCCI flows to state and regional cricket \\nassociations in the form of grants to maintain stadia, conduct matches, organize \\ntraining camps, and other ancillary purposes. Counsel relied on the objects \\nof Saurashtra Cricket Association which inter alia include, the control, \\nsupervision, regulation, encouragement, promotion and development of the game \\nof cricket in the Association’s jurisdiction.  Other objects include creation, \\nfostering friendly relationships through sports tournaments and the creation of a \\nhealthy sportsmanship spirit, through the medium of sports in general and cricket \\nin particular. All other objects were similar, including “to arrange, and/or \\nmanage among other things league and/or any other tournaments” ; organize \\nmatches, lay out grounds for playing cricket, organization of matches in aid of \\npublic charities, etc. If these associations sell tickets and generate revenue \\nthrough  other activities, those do not necessarily mean that their objects are \\ncommerc ial or to promote trade. Selling tickets for a sport  performance or match  \\nis to promote cricket, and not trade . Mr. Salve also urged that the expression \\n“trade” has a particular  meaning; he referred to State of Gujarat v. Maheshkumar \\nDhirajal Thakkar83 where the court observed that  \\n“the word trade in its narrow popular sense means ‘exchange of goods for \\ngoods or for money with the object of making profit’. In its widest sense it  \\nincludes any business carried on with a view to earn profit84.

Therefore, separate books of accounts are not \\nrequired to be maintained in terms of Sec tion 11(4A) read with the fifth and \\nseventh proviso to Section 10(23C) of IT Act, 1961. It was urged that ICAI was \\nnot hit by the proviso to S ection  2(15) of the IT Act (inserted w.e.f. 01.04.2009) \\nsince its activities fall within the purview of the clause  “education” specified in \\nthe definition of the expression “charitable purpose” in S. 2(15) of the said Act, \\nand not the residuary clause relating to the GPU category, wherein the proviso \\nsolely applies to the latter.

The surplus amounts remaining \\nwere invested in government securities/FDs of nationalized banks, so the \\ndemands raised will seriously prejudice the assessees.  \\n86.

It was urged that the \\nimpugned judgment passed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court99 in Tribune’s \\ncase dismissing the Tribune’s appeal, erroneously relied on para 17 of Surat Art \\nSilk decision (su pra) which wrongly quoted the Privy council judgment in the \\nTribune’s case.   \\n87. It was further argued that collecting advertisements for consideration \\ncannot be treated as business activity undertaken by profit because the sale price \\nof the newspaper is ₹2 whereas the cost of printing each newspaper is ₹12 and \\nthe deficits can be made up only through advertisements. Placing reliance on the \\nextracts from the will of the late Sardar Dyal Singh Majithia it was urged that the \\n \\n98 (1972) 4 SCC 474  \\n99 ITA Nos. 62 of 2015 and 147 of 2016 (O&M)  ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Upon this court’s query with respect to advancing submissions on the \\nconstitutional aspect in the ITPO judgment  (supra) , the learned senior counsel \\nadvanced his submissions on the validity of Section  2(15) in the context of \\nArticle 14 and Article 289.  It was submitted that classification made in the ITPO \\njudgment i.e., institutions driven by profit motive vis-à-vis institutions driven by \\nmotive to advance objective of GPU, was correct and is in tune with the decision \\nof this court in NDMC  (supra). It was urged that Article 289(1) will not apply to \\nITPO as its income and property cannot be regarded as income and property of a \\nState. It was also submitted that proviso to Section 2(15) applies only to the last \\nlimb i.e., “advancement of object of general public utility”  and not to the \\npreceding limb “education”  and in respect of charity there is no discernible \\ndifference between the two. Since there is no intelligible differentia and rational \\nnexus in this regard, this discrimination offends Article 14.  \\n89. It was argued  that the term “for a cess or fee or any other consideration”  \\nused in Section 2(15) is clearly violative of Article 14 as it fails to make a \\ndistinction between activities that are carried out by the State or by the \\ninstrumentalities or agencies of the State, and those carried out by commercial \\nentities for which a consideration is charged. In addition, Art icle 289(1) exempts \\nstates’ property and income from Union taxation. To permit levy of income tax \\non cess or fee collected by a state would violate Art icle 289(1), hence the word \\n“cess” or “fee” in the proviso is liable to be declared unconstitutional and \\nviolative not only of Article 14 but of Article 289 as well, in the context of state \\nundertakings.

Revenue’s rebuttal arguments  \\n90. In rebuttal to the submissions advanced by the assessees , the ASG relied \\nupon Adityapur  Industrial Area Development Authority v. Union of India100 and \\nsubmitted that there is no constitutional immunity from taxation, for the state, \\nbecause by Article 289(2) even state or its instrumentalities/agencies are not \\nimmune from taxation if they carry on trade or business. In light of Art icle 289(2), \\nthere is no constitutional bar for the States (or the Union) to engage or carry on \\ntrade or business, and Article 289 allows the Parliament to impose taxes on such \\ntrade or business. The ratio  in NDMC  (supra)  has to be read in light of the \\nprovisions and the judgment rendered in Shri Ra mtanu Coop erative  Housing \\nSociety (supra)  should in turn be read in light of NDMC. The decisive factor \\ntherefore is not the status of the entity, but the nature of activity carried by it. If \\nthe nature of activity is trade or business with a profit motive, then the same can \\nbe taxed even if it is carried by state or its instrumentalities. It was also contended \\nthat Article 289 does not grant absolute any immunity fro m taxation.  \\n91. The revenue further submitted that the validity of the amendment can be \\ntested especially in the case of exclusions or exemptions on limited grounds - \\ninvalidity, arbitrariness, unreasonableness, discrimination; and the assessees have \\nnot m ade out a case under any such ground. Also, by referring to In Re: Trustees \\nof the Tribune and All India Spinners Association  of Mirzapur  (supra), it was \\ncontended that “general public utility” is only a statutory creation so as to form \\npart of charitable purposes and it can always be given a statutory import by \\nsubjecting it to conditions and limitations prescribed under Section 2(15), at \\ndifferent points of time.

Analysis and reasoning  \\n92. The history of the statute and the evolving interpretation of “charitable \\npurpose ” reveals that in - P. Krishna Warriar  (supra) , this court extensively \\nconsidered the previous jurisprudence on the subject  (in light of the pre -existing \\nSection 4(3) of the old law ), as well as the amendment introduced in 1953 . At \\nthat time,  income  of a charitable organization,  earned from business  was subject \\nto limitations. The limitations were that (i) the business was to be carried on in \\nthe course of the actual carrying out of a primary purpose of the trust or \\ninstitution ; or (ii) the work in connection with the business was to be mainly \\ncarried on by beneficiaries of the institution.  These expressions were considered \\nin Krishna Warri ar (supra) , where the court held that the term “property” (of a \\ntrust) was of widest amplitude, which included business. The following decision, \\nin Andhra Chamber  of Commerce  (supra) where the chamber of commerce had \\namong its objects, one enabling it to advocate policies or legislation, or op pose \\nthem, in addition to the object of promoting business, held that the incidental \\ninclusion of such objects, involving  espousing a political purpose, did not \\nundermine its essential or main purpose, of advancing objects of general public \\nutility.  The new provision, i.e. , Section 2(15) of the IT Act, defined “charitable \\npurpose” restrictively : to deny tax exemption to activities for profit  which were \\ncarried on by a trust for the advancement of an object of general public utility.  \\nThe reason for this change (discussed previously) was that the advantage of tax \\nexemption was not intended  to charitable trusts that were commercial concerns, \\nwhich while ostensibly serving a public purpose, were fully paid for the benefits \\nprovided by them.

The first two decisions of some note  are Lok Shikshana Trust  and Indian \\nChamber of Commerce  (supra) . The former decision, by majority, held that to \\nqualify as a charitable purpose, two ingredients had to be satisfied. It was held \\nthat the change in the definition meant that to be the fourth category of charitable \\npurpose, it was necessary to show that   \\n“(1) the purpose of the trust is the advancement of any other object of general \\npublic utility, and (2) the above purpose does not involve the carrying on of \\nany activity for profit. Both the above conditions must be fulfilled before the \\npurpose of the trust  can be held to be charitable purpose.”  \\n \\n94. In Indian Chamber  of Commerce  this court categorically held that even if \\nthe activity for profit, is to further an object of general public utility, the charity \\ncould not claim  of exemption. The court went on to indicate the following test:  \\n“21. The true test is to ask for answers to t he following questions: (a) Is the \\nobject of the assessee one of general public utility? (b) Does the advancement \\nof the object involve activities bringing in moneys? (c) If so, are such \\nactivities undertaken (i) for profit or (ii) without profit? Even if (a) and (b) \\nare answered affirmatively, if (c)(i) is answered affirmatively, the claim for \\nexemption collapses. The solution to the problem of an activity being \\none for or irrespective of profit is gathered on a footing of facts. What is the \\nreal nature of  the activity? One which is ordinarily carried on by ordinary \\npeople for gain? Is there a built -in prescription in the constitution against \\nmaking a profit?....”   \\n \\n95. The decision in Surat Art  Silk, needs careful scrutiny, not only because it \\nis by a larger Bench, but also because it has been the bulwark of the assessee’s \\ncontentions - and has been the premise upon which almost all High Courts have \\ninterpreted Section 2 (15) after its amendment, in 200 8. As noticed earlier, the \\nold Act  (in Section 4(3))  did not contain any terms, restricting or prohibiting \\ncharities from engaging in commercial activities or those which yielded profit. \\nNo doubt, the idea of income from business carried on  “behalf of a religious or \\ncharitable institution” being exempt, provided “the business is carried on in the \\ncourse of the actual carrying out of a primary purpose of the institution” was \\nintroduced by amendment, in 1953.

The earlier \\ndecisions in Indian Chamber of Commerce, and Lok Shikshana Trust  (supra) \\nnoticed this cha nge. Surat Art (supra) was yet another a departure. While it  \\nconsidered the previous decisions of the court , it consciously departed from them, \\nand even overruled the interpretation in Indian Chamber of Commerce (supra). \\nThe larger Bench in Surat Art  Silk agreed with the previous decisions to the effect \\nthat the motivation for the activity in question ( i.e., for it to be charitable) should \\nnot be deriving of profits. However,  the larger Bench enunciated the principle of \\n‘predominant object’ and held that what was of importance was “ whether the \\npredominant object of the activity involved in carrying out the object  of general \\npublic utility is to subserve the charitable purpose or to earn profit” and that such \\nan entity would not lose its charitable character merely because some profit arose \\nfrom the said activity.  \\n96. Thus,  was born the ‘predominant object ’ test, of an organization, to \\ndetermine whether it was essentially charitable, or ‘for profit ’. If the predominant \\nobject was not for profit,  but advancement of general public utility, that some \\nprofits were earned, would not debar it from claiming to be a n organization with \\na charitable purpose. However, if the predominant object was such that profit \\nmaking was “enwrapped ” or “intertwined ” with it, the organization or trust could \\nnot be called charitable. Crucially, the court emphasized that the manner of \\ncarrying on of the activity in question,  was determinative:  \\n“the nature of the charitable purpose, the manner in which the activity for \\nadvancing the charitable purpose is being carried on and the surrounding \\ncircumstances may clearly indicate that the activity is not propelled by a \\ndominant profit motive.”  \\n97. Interestingly, the test proposed by the majority judgment in Surat Art  Silk \\nis similar to the one advocated in Indian Chamber of Commerce (which it \\noverruled). The difference in approach is that Surat Art  Silk advocated the \\n“predominant object” test to see whether the object is for advanceme nt of general \\npublic utility, bereft  of profit motive, whereas in Indian Chamber of Commerce  ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The second difference between the two decisions, is that Surat Art  Silk \\nstated that there is no need for an express provision in the constitution of a given \\ntrust, eschewing  profit motive, whereas in Indian Chamber of Commerce, the \\nnecessity of such a condition was highlighted.  \\n98. The judgments of this court, after Surat Art Silk  (supra),  noticed the \\nenunciation of, and the need to apply the test of “dominant” object . In \\nCommissioner of Income Tax v . Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce \\nand Industries101 it was, thus held:   \\n“In other words, the majority view in the Surat Art Silk's case (supra) was that \\nthe condition that the purpose should not involve the carrying on of any activity \\nfor profit would be satisfied if profit -making is not the real object. The theory \\nof dominant or primary object of the trust has, therefore, been treated to be \\nthe determining factor, even in regard to the fourth head of charity , viz., the \\nadvancement of any other object of general public utility, so as to make the \\ncarrying on of business activity merely ancillary or incidental to the main \\nobject.”  \\n \\n99. In Bar Council of Maharashtra  (supra)  this court considered whether a bar \\ncouncil, constituted under the Advocates Act , 1961 , performed activities that \\nwere charitable in nature; it was held that the statute obliged several activities \\nwhose dominant object was advancement of public utility, without profit motive. \\nThis court held that the provisions of the Act  \\n“enjoined upon avowedly with the objective of protecting the litigating public \\nfrom unscrupulous professionals by taking them to task for any misconduct \\non their part; it is also one of the obligatory functions of a State Bar Council \\nto promote and support measures for law reform as also to conduct law \\nseminars and organise talks on legal topics by eminent jurists, obviously with \\na view to educate the general public, the function prescrib ed by Clause (eee) \\nis obviously charitable in nature, the same being to organise legal aid to the \\npoor.

The view that prevailed, after the decision in Surat Art Silk (supra), \\ntherefore, was that so long as the “dominant” object of a trust was charitable, and \\nit did not essentially involve in business or commercial activity, the generation of \\nprofits, or surpluses by it, through activities, incidental to that main or do minant \\nactivity, did not undermine its charitable purpose, as long as the surpluses or \\nprofits, were used for the advancement of an object of general public utility.   \\n101. An interesting detail, is that the old Act  did not define “charitable purpose”  \\nrestrictively, in the manner that the IT Act did, when enacted, in 1961. This lent \\na fair degree of interpretive flexibility, to the courts, to decide whether a \\ncommercial or business element, could be interwoven with a charitable object. \\nThe amendment of 1953 ensured that income “applied or accumulated for \\napplication to such .. charitable purposes as relate to anything done within the \\ntaxable territories, and in the case of property so held in part only for such \\npurposes, the income applied or finally set apar t for application …”102 could not \\nbe included  as taxable income of any charitable organization. This provision is a \\nprecursor for Section 11 under the IT Act.  In other words, the structure of the old \\nAct did not prohibit the carrying on of business; it spelt out a condition that any \\nincome derived from business “carried on in the course of the actual carrying \\nout of a primary purpose of the institution” if applied for charitable purposes , \\nwas exempt.  \\n102. The second aspect is that  Surat Art Silk  (supra) , was rendered in the context \\nof Section 2(15) of the IT Act, as it stood originally. However, by the Taxation \\nLaws Amendment Act, 1975 (w.e.f. 01 .04.1977), Section 13(1)(bb) was inserted. \\n \\n102 Section 4(3)(i) of the old IT Act.

Aids to interpretation  \\n(i) History of the legislation  \\n107. The amendments (i.e. Finance Act  2008 , Finance Act  2009, Finance Act \\n2012 and Finance Act 2015) do not throw light – by way of statement of objects \\nand reasons or notes on clauses . The court, therefore would have to resort to the \\nsurrounding circumstances that led to the amendment.  \\n108. The words of a statute are to be construed in their terms, according to the \\ncircumstances in which they occur. A t the same time, there is some aut hority for \\nthe proposition that statutes – particularly amending provisions, may be \\nconsidered in the light of the previous history of the legislation. Justice Cardozo  \\nin Duparquet Co. v. Evans105 said that  in questions relating to construction,  \\n\"history is a teacher that is not to be ignored ”. In a similar vein, Chief Judge \\nLearned Hand said that “statutes always have some purpose or object to \\naccomplish, whose sympathetic and imaginative discovery is the surest guide to \\ntheir meaning ”106. \\n109. Some decisions of this Court have highlighted this aspect.  In Bhuwalka \\nSteel Indus. Ltd. & Ors. v .

But, \\nthe primary rule of construction would be to ascertain the plain language \\nused in the enactment which advances the purpose and object of the \\nlegislation...”  \\n \\n110. In Chief Justice of Andhra Pradesh & Ors. v . L.V.A. Dixitulu & Ors .108 \\nagain, the court held that resort to the history of the legislation is legitimate, for \\ninterpreting a provision :  \\n“..in order to ascertain the true meaning of the terms and phrases employed, \\nit is legitimate for the Court to go beyond the arid literal confines of the \\nprovision and to call in aid other well -recognised rules of construction, such \\nas its legislative history, the basic scheme and framework of the statute as a \\nwhole, each portion throwing light on the rest, the purpose of the legisla tion, \\nthe object sought to be achieved, and the consequences that may flow from \\nthe adoption of one in preference to the other possible interpretation.”  \\n \\n111. Other decisions109 have also commented on the use of history of the \\nlegislation as a tool for its construction.  It is, therefore, clear that courts can look \\nat the previous history  of the statute , and the changes it underwent  to discern what \\nis intended by the lawmakers whe n an amendment is introduced , or a new law \\nenacted. In light of these factors, it would therefore , also be useful for the court \\nto consider the background which led to the amendment – firstly in 2008 and \\nthereafter in 2012 and 2015, seeking to restrict the  nature of activities that a GPU \\ncategory charity can legitimately undertake.  \\n \\n(ii) Other extrinsic aids to construction of the statute  \\n(a) Speeches in Parliament  \\n112.

The CBDT will, following the usual practice, \\nissue an explanatory circular containing  guidelines for determining \\nwhether an entity is carrying on any activity in the nature of  trade,  \\ncommerce or business or any activity of rendering any service in relation \\nto any trade, commerce or  business. Whether the purpose is a charitable \\npurpose will depend on the totality of the facts of the  case.

Whether such an entity is carrying on an activity in the nature of \\ntrade, commerce or business is a question of fact which will be decided bas ed \\non the  nature, scope, extent and frequency of the activity.  \\n3.1. There are industry and trade associations who claim exemption from tax \\nu/s 11 on the ground that their  objects are for charitable purpose as these are \\ncovered under ‘any other object of ge neral public utility’.

In such cases, there must \\nbe complete identity between the contributors and the  participants.   \\nTherefore, where industry or trade a ssociations claim both to be charitable \\ninstitutions as well as mutual  organizations and their activities are restricted \\nto contributions from and participation of only their members,  these would \\nnot fall under the purview of the proviso to section 2(15) o wing to the \\nprinciple of mutuality.  However, if such organizations have dealings with \\nnon-members, their claim to be charitable organizations  would now be \\ngoverned by the additional conditions stipulated in the proviso to section 2 \\n(15).” \\n \\n114. Circular No. 1/2009  dated 27.03.2009 contains explanatory notes to \\nprovisions of the Finance Act, 2008. It inter alia reads as follows:  \\n“5. Streamlining the definition of \"charitable purpose\"  \\n5.1 Sub-section (15) of section 2 of the Act defines \"charitable purpose\" to  \\ninclude relief of the poor, education, medical relief, and the advancement of \\nany other  object of general public utility. It has been noticed that a number \\nof entities operating  on commercial lines are claiming exemption on their \\nincome either under sub -section  (23C) of section 10 or section 11 of the Act \\non the ground that they are charitable  institutions. This is based on the \\nargument that they are engaged in the \"advancement  of an object of general \\npublic utility\" as is included in the fourth  limb of the current  definition of \\n\"charitable purpose\". Such a claim, when made in respect of an activity  \\ncarried out on commercial lines, is contrary to the intention of the provision.  \\n5.2 With a view to limiting the scope of the phrase “advancement of any \\nother  object of general public utility\", sub -section (15) of section 2 has been \\namended to  provide that the advancement of any other object of general \\npublic utility shall not be  a charitable purpose, if it involves the carrying on \\nof any activity in the nature of  trade, commerce or business, or any activity \\nof rendering any service in relation to  any trade, commerce or business, for \\na cess or fee or any other consideration,  irrespective of the nature of use or \\napplication, or retention,  of the income from such  activity.

Senior counsel  appearing  for the assesse es relied on Section 119 of the IT \\nAct as well as decisions of this court, reported as Navnit Lal  Jhaveri (supra) and \\nUCO Bank Calcutta (supra) and argued  that departmental circulars are binding \\nupon tax administrators, and should be legitimately considered as aids of \\nconstruction. This was in support of their reliance on the circulars in the present \\ncase (No.11/2008 and No. 1/2009).  \\n116. This court in Navn it Lal Jhaveri  (supra) considered Sections 2(6A)(e) and \\n12(1B) of the IT Act  which were introduced by the Finance Act, 15 , 1955 (w.e.f. \\n01.04.1955).  As a result of these amendments, the combined effect of the two \\nprovisions was that three kinds of payments  made to shareholders companies to \\nwhich those applied, were treated as taxable dividend to the extent of the \\naccumulated profits held by the company. The provision was challenged. It was  \\nnoticed that while introducing the amendment, the Finance Minister assured that \\noutstanding loans and advances – otherwise liable to taxation as dividends in AY \\n1955 -56, would not be subjected to tax if it were shown that they had been \\ngenuinely refunded to the respective companies before 30 .06.1955. The \\ngovernment felt that unless such a step was taken, the operation of Section 12(1B) \\nwould lead to extreme hardship, as it would cover the aggregate of all outstanding \\nloans of past years and could have led to unreasonably high liability on \\nshareholders to whom the loans might have been advanced. A circular [No. \\n20(XXI -6) /55] was issued by the Central Board of Revenue on 10.05.1955 . The \\ncourt, in that context, observed that:  \\n“It is clear that a circular of t he kind which was issued by the Board would \\nbe binding on all officers and persons employed in the execution of the Act \\nunder s. 5(8) of the Act. This circular pointed out to all the officers that it \\nwas likely that some of the companies might have advance d loans to their \\nshareholders as a result of genuine transactions of loans, and the idea was \\nnot to the effect such transactions and not to bring them within the mischief \\nof the new provision.  \\nThe officers were, therefore, asked to intimate to all the companies that if the \\nloans were repaid before the 30th June, 1955, in a genuine manner, they would \\nnot be taken into account in determining the tax liability of the shareholders \\nto whom they may have been advanced.

Section \\n12(1B) would, therefore, normally apply to loans granted by the companies, \\nto their respective shareholders with full notice of the provisions pr escribed \\nby it.”  \\n \\n117. This court ultimately upheld the amendments. As is evident, the judgment \\nnoticed that the circular sought to soften the rigors of the otherwise harsh \\nconsequence of immediate application of the amendment. There was nothing in \\nthe circular to make it applic able for all times to come. It was more in the nature \\nof the government issuing a temporary suspension of operation of the substantive \\nprovision, introduced by the amendment.  \\n118.  In UCO Bank, Calcutta  (supra) , this court had to deal with circulars issue d \\nunder Section 145 regarding the method of accounting to be followed, in the \\ncontext of bank loans to be written off, when an assessee was following the \\nmercantile system (of accounting). The court inter alia, held that  under Section \\n119 (2) of the IT Act , the Central Board of Direct Taxes is empowered, for  proper \\nand efficient management of assessment and collection of revenue to issue \\ngeneral or special orders in respect of any class of incomes or class of cases \\nsetting forth directions or instructions,  not being prejudicial to assessees, as the \\nguidelines, principles or procedures to be followed in the work relating to \\nassessment.  The court held that the   \\n“9. […] The Board thus has power, inter alia, to tone down the rigour of the \\nlaw and ensure a fair enforcement of its provisions, by issuing circulars in \\nexercise of its statutory powers under Section 119 of the Income -tax Act \\nwhich are binding on the authorities in the administration of the Act. Under \\nSection 119(2)(a), however, the circulars as c ontemplated therein cannot be \\nadverse to the assessee. Thus, the authority which wields the power for its \\nown advantage under the Act is given the right to forego the advantage when \\nrequired to wield it in a manner it considers just by relaxing the rigour of \\nthe law or in other permissible manners as laid down in Section 119.

What \\nis of note in that judgment, is that the question o f whether circulars or explanatory \\nnotes issued by the executive are binding aids of construction was not discussed; \\nmore importantly, the court first interpreted the statute, in its own terms, and then \\ncited the circular.  \\n120. That circulars are per se not binding upon courts, in regard to interpretation \\nof a statutory provision and, at best are guides or aid to interpretation for \\ndepartmental authorities, who are bound to take them into account, was pithily \\nstated in Keshavji Ravji & Co. and Ors. v. Comm issioner of Income Tax113 where \\nthe court observed as follows:  \\n“This contention and the proposition on which it rests, namely, that all \\ncirculars issued by the Board have a binding legal quality incurs, quite \\nobviously, the criticism of being too broadly stated. The Board cannot \\npreempt a judicial interpretation of th e scope and ambit of a provision of the \\n'Act' by issuing circulars on the subject. This is too obvious a proposition to \\nrequire any argument for it. A circular cannot even impose on the tax payer \\na burden higher than what the Act itself on a true interpret ation envisages. \\nThe task of interpretation of the laws is the exclusive domain of the courts. \\nHowever, this is what Sri Ramachandran really has in mind - circulars \\nbeneficial to the assessees and which tone down the rigour of the law issued \\nin exercise of  the statutory power under Section 119 of the Act or under \\ncorresponding provisions of the predecessor Act are binding on the \\nauthorities in the administration of the Act. The Tribunal, much less the High \\nCourt, is an authority under the Act. The circulars  do not bind them. But the \\nbenefits of such circulars to the assessees have been held to be permissible \\neven though the circulars might have departed from the strict tenor of the \\nstatutory provision and mitigated the rigour of the law. But that is not the \\nsame thing as saying that such circulars would either have a binding effect in \\nthe interpretation of the provision itself or that the Tribunal and the High \\nCourt are supposed to interpret the law in the light of the circular.

This view was accepted in Commissioner of Customs v .

No proposition was laid down in that case that even if the circular was \\nclearly contrary to the provisions of the Act it should prevail, On the other \\nhand, the learned Judges were inclined to view the circular as granting the \\nbenefit of exemption from  the operation of the impugned provisions subject \\nto fulfilment of certain conditions. Navnit Lal's case was referred to and \\nconstrued in two cases decided by Benches of two learned Judges. The first \\none was the case of Ellerman Lines Ltd. v.

These three decisions were \\nrepeatedly referred to and relied on in the subsequent decisions in which the \\nissue arose as regards the binding nature of the circul ars either under the \\nIncome Tax Act or under the Central Excise Act. In between, there was the \\nthree Judge Bench decision in Sirpur Paper Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of \\nWealth Tax [1970]77ITR6(SC) in which Section 13 of the Wealth Tax Act \\ncorresponding to S ection 5(8) of the Income Tax Act, 1922 fell for \\nconsideration.

In the opinion of this court, the views expressed in Keshavji Ravji, Indian \\nOil Corporation and Ratan Melting and Wire Industries (though th e last decision \\ndoes not cite Navnit Lal  Jhaveri ), reflect the correct position, i.e. , that circulars \\nare binding upon departmental authorities, if they advance a proposition within \\nthe framework of the statutory provision.

Previously, in Vanguard Fire and Insurance Company Ltd. v. M/s. \\nFraser and Ross and Anr.118, it was held that the term “ unless the context \\notherwise requires” implies that the word or term so defined should be applied – \\nsubject to the context . It was held that in view of such a qualification, the Court \\nhas not only to look at the words but also to look at the context, collocation , and \\nthe object of such words in respect of such matters and fact or the meaning to be \\nconveyed by the use of the words under the circumstances. Almost the same \\nreasoning has been echoed in N.K. Jain and Ors. v. C.K. Shah and Ors119.  \\n125. The importance of terms expressly defined in a statute is that they are \\ninternal an d binding  aids to interpretation. The prefacing – to any definition – of \\nthe phrase “ unless the context otherwise requires ” merely signifies that in case \\nthere is anything expressly to the contrary, in any specific provision (s) in the body \\nof the Act, a different meaning can be attributed. However, to discern the purport \\nof a provision, the term, as defined has to prevail, whenever the expression  is used \\nin the statute. This rule is subje ct to the  except ion that when a contrary i ntention  \\nis plain , in particular instances , that meaning is to be given . Therefore, in the light \\nof the previous discussion, this court would interpret the true meaning of \\n“charitable purpose” after its amendment in 2008 , taking into consideration the \\nsubsequent changes.   \\n126. As observed at the beginning of this judgment, GPU charities have been \\nrecognized as distinct from the ‘per se  categories ’ of charity (education, medical \\nrelief, relief to the poor ; and later - preservation of water sheds, monuments, \\nenvironment , and yoga). The judgment of this court in Dharmadeepti  (supra)  has \\nclarified that the per se categories  – are not subjected to the restrictive condition \\nof eschewing activities of profit.

Although \\nthe occasion did not so arise in Surat Art Silk (supra)  (since this Court was dealing \\nwith AYs prior to 1975 ), the provision in Section 13(1)(bb) which prevailed then \\nwith effect from 01.04.1977 made the position clearer in that it permi tted these \\nper se  category charities , in the course of their actual carrying on of their \\nactivities, to earn profits. Of course, this provision was deleted from 01.04.1984. \\nAlongside, the restriction imposed on GPUs from engaging in activities for profit , \\nwas also deleted.  \\n127. As noticed in Thanthi Trust  (supra) , Section 11(4A) was originally \\nintroduced with effect from 01.04.1984 and substituted w.e.f. 01.04.1991. At that \\nstage, the statute as it stood, did not restrict GPU category charities from carrying \\non activities of profit or from carrying on business. This court nevertheless was \\nbound by the decision in Surat Art  Silk (supra)  which had ruled that : \\n(i) A GPU category charity with a constitution granting  discretion  to the \\ntrustees to engage in charitable and non -charitable activities , could not \\nclaim the exemption;  \\n(ii) The main or dominant purpose of the GPU category charity had to be \\nessentially charitable. If it was so, and it incidentally entailed carrying \\non activities that led to profit, it was entitled to exemption.  \\n128. This court’s understanding of the law as exp ressed in Thanthi Trust  was \\ntherefore, coloured by the statute as it existed , and the formulation in Surat Art  \\nSilk (supra) . As a result, Thanthi Trust , interpreted Section 11(4A) in this \\nbackground and held that the assessee in that case incidentally was engaged in \\nactivities for profit. The court was also of the opinion that Section 11(4A) was \\nwider than the revenue urged it to be, in that activities by way of business could \\nnot be carried on incidentally by a Trust , which otherwise was a GPU category \\ntrust.

There was otherwise no \\nmeaningful statutory change.  The position therefore, continued as it was for about \\n25 years.  \\n130. After its introduction, by amendment in 2008, Section 2(15) read as \\nfollows:  \\n(15) “charitable purpose” includes relief of the poor, education, medical \\nrelief, and the advancement of any other object of general public utility:  \\nProvided that the advancement of any other object of general public utility \\nshall not be a charitable purp ose, if it involves the carrying on of any activity \\nin the nature of trade, commerce or business, or any activity of rendering any \\nservice in relation to any trade, commerce or business, for a cess or fee or \\nany other consideration, irrespective of the nat ure of use or application, or \\nretention, of the income from such activity;”  \\n131.

Coming back to the \\nlanguage of clause (2), a question is raised, why does the proviso speak of \\ntaxation  in respect of trade or business  when the main limb of sub -section \\n(1) speaks only of taxes i n respect of lands or buildings and income? Is the \\nambit of proviso wider than the main limb? Is it an independent provision of \\na substantive nature notwithstanding the label given to it as a proviso? Or is \\nit only an exception? It is asked. We are, howeve r, of the considered opinion \\nthat it is more important to give effect to the language of and the intention \\nunderlying the proviso than to find a label for it. It is clarificatory in nature \\nwithout a doubt; it appears to be more indeed. It is concerned main ly with \\nthe “income” (of Provincial Governments) referred to in the main limb of \\nsub-section (1). It speaks of tax on the “lands or buildings” in that context \\nalone, as we shall explain in the next paragraph. The idea underlying the \\nproviso is to make it c lear that the exemption of income of Provincial \\nGovernment operates only where the income is earned or received by it as a \\nGovernment; it will not avail where the income is earned or received by the \\nProvincial Government on account of or from any trade or business carried \\non by it — that is  a trade or a business carried on with profit motive. In the \\nlight of the language of the proviso to Section 155 and clause (2) of Article \\n289, it is not possible to say that every activity carried on by the Government \\nis governmental activity. A distinction has to be made between governmental \\nactivity  and trade and business carried on by the Government, at least for \\nthe purposes of this clause. It is for this reason, we say, that unless an activity \\nin the nature of trade and business is carried on with a profit motive, it would \\nnot be a trade or business contemplated by clause (2). For example, mere \\nsale of government properties, immovable or moveable, or granting of leases \\nand licences in respect of its properties does no t amount to carrying on trade \\nor business. Only where a  trade or business  is carried on with a profit motive \\n— or any property is used or occupied for the purpose of carrying on such \\ntrade or business — that the proviso [or for that matter clause (2) of Ar ticle \\n289] would be attracted. Where there is no profit motive involved  in any \\nactivity  carried on by the State Government, it cannot be said to be carrying \\non a trade or business within the meaning of the proviso/clause (2), merely \\nbecause some profit res ults from the activity [ For example, almost every \\nState Government maintains one or more guest houses in Delhi for \\naccommodating their officials and others connected with the affairs of the \\nState. But, when some rooms/accommodation are not occupied by suc h \\npersons and remain vacant, outsiders are accommodated therein, though at \\nhigher rates. This activity cannot obviously be called carrying on trade or \\nbusiness nor can it be said that the building is used or occupied for the \\npurpose of any trade or busines s carried on by the State Government.] . We \\nmay pause here a while and explain why we are attaching such restricted \\nmeaning to the words “trade or business” in the proviso to Section 155 and \\nin clause (2) of Article 289. Both the words import substantially  the same \\nidea though, ordinarily speaking, the expression “business” appears to be \\nwider in its content.

The court also emphasized that mere sale or lease of government \\nproperty does not imply trade or business. The crucial or determinative element \\nin the venture, so to say, is whether performance of a function is actuated by profit \\nmotive.  \\n142. What then is the true meaning of the expressions “ fee, cess or \\nconsideration ”?

The impermissibility of any trade, or commercial  activity or service, and \\nincome, from them, was intended to be conveyed through the prohibition, in the \\nfirst part of the definition of  GPU charities.

However, the use of the expression “cess” facially \\nlends a different colour to all the three expressions.  \\n144.  “Fee, cess and any other consideration ”  has to receive a purposive \\ninterpretation, in the present context. If fee or cess or such consideration is \\ncollected for the purpose of an activity, by a state department or entity, which is \\nset up by statute, its mandate to collect such amounts cannot be  treated as \\nconsideration  towards trade or business. Therefore, regulatory activity, \\nnecessitating fee or cess collection in terms of enacted law, or collection of \\namounts in furtherance of  activities such as education, regulation of profession, \\netc., are per se not business or commercial in nature. Likewise, statutory boards \\nand authorities, who are under mandate to develop housing, industrial and other \\nestates, including development of res idential housing at reasonable or subsidized \\ncosts, which might entail charging higher amounts from some section of the \\nbeneficiaries, to cross -subsidize the main activity, cannot be characterized as \\nengaging in business. The character of being ‘state’, and such corporations or \\nbodies set up under specific laws  (whether by states or the centre) would , \\ntherefore , not mean that the amounts are ‘fee’ or ‘cess’ to provid e some \\ncommercial or business service.  In each case, at the same time, the mere \\nnomenclature  of the consideration being a “fee” or “cess”, is not conclusive. If \\nthe fee or cess, or other consideration is to provide an essential service, in larger \\npublic interest, such as water cess or sewage cess or fee, such consideration, \\nreceived by a statutor y body, would not be considered “trade, commerce or \\nbusiness” or service in relation to those.

This Court has in some decisions considered the term \"cess\". In  Shinde \\nBrothers Etc. v. Deputy Commissioner, Raichur and Ors .131, Justice M. \\nHidyatullah , (though his was a dissenting judgment, yet no contrary opinion was \\nexpressed by majority in regard to “cess”) said that:  \\n“... The word \"cess\" is used in Ireland and is still in use in India although the \\nword rate has replaced it in England. It means a ta x and is generally used \\nwhen the levy is for some special administrative expense which the name \\n(health cess, education cess, road cess etc.) indicates. When levied as an \\nincrement to an existing tax, the name matters not for the validity of the cess \\nmust be judged of in the same way as the validity of the tax to which it is an \\nincrement. By Schedule A(1) read with Section 3 of the Act, it is collected as \\nan additional levy with a tax, which, as described in Schedule A, is \\nundoubtedly one within the powers of the State Legislature and has been so \\neven prior to the Constitution....”  \\n146. The seven -judge bench judgment of this court in  India Cement Ltd. & Ors. \\nv. State of Tamil Nadu and Ors .132, approved the definition propounded by \\nHidayatulla, J. In  Vijayalas hmi Rice Mill and Ors. v. Commercial Tax Officers, \\nPalakol & Ors133 this court observed that  \\n“13. Hence ordinarily a cess is also a tax, but is a special kind of tax. \\nGenerally tax raises revenue which can be used generally for any purpose by \\nthe State. For  instance, the income tax or excise tax or sales tax are taxes \\nwhich generate revenue which can be utilised by the Union or the State \\nGovernments for any purpose e.g. for payment of salary to the members of the \\narmed forces or civil servants, police, etc. or for development programmes, \\netc. However, cess is a tax which generates revenue which is utilised for a \\nspecific purpose. For instance, health cess raises revenue which is utilised for \\nhealth purposes e.g. building hospitals, giving medicines to the poo r, etc. \\nSimilarly, education cess raises revenue which is used for building schools or \\nother educational purposes.”  \\n147. The expression \"cess\" , therefore, implies a tax or impost levied for some \\nspecial purpose, which may be levied as an increment to an ex isting tax. The term \\n“fee”, to some extent, has a similar meaning. In  The Commissioner of Income \\nTax, Lucknow v. U.P.

Fiat India (P) Ltd. & Ors136 this \\ncourt explained the meaning of th at term:  \\n“Consideration means something which is of value in the eyes of law, \\nmoving from the Plaintiff, either of benefit to the Plaintiff or of detriment to \\nthe Defendant. In other words, it may consist either in some right, interest, \\nprofit or benefit a ccruing to the one party, or some forbearance, detriment, \\nloss or responsibility, given, suffered or undertaken by the other, as \\nobserved in the case of Currie v.

In Salmond on Jurisprudence, the word 'consideration' has been \\nexplained in the following words.  \\nA consideration in its widest sense is the reason, motive or inducement, by \\nwhich a man is moved to bind himself by an agreement. It is for nothing \\nthat he consents to impose an obligation upon himself, or to abandon or \\ntransfer a right. It is in consideration of such and such a fact that he agrees \\nto bear new burdens or to forego the benefits which the law already allows \\nhim. \\n57. The gist of the term 'con sideration' and its legal significance has been \\nclearly summed up in Section 2(d) of the Indian Contract Act which \\ndefines 'consideration' thus:  \\n‘When, at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has \\ndone or abstained from doing, or doe s or abstains from doing, or promises \\nto do or to abstain from doing, something, such act or abstinence or \\npromise is called a consideration to the promise.’  \\n58. From a conspectus of decisions and dictionary meaning, the \\ninescapable conclusion that follows is that 'consideration' means a \\nreasonable equivalent or other valuable benefit passed on by the promisor \\nto the promisee or by the transferor to the transfe ree. Similarly, when the \\nword 'consideration' is qualified by the word 'sole', it makes consideration \\nstronger so as to make it sufficient and valuable having regard to the facts, \\ncircumstances and necessities of the case.”  \\n150. Therefore, what Parliament intended – through the amendments in question \\nwas to proscribe, involvement or engagement of GPU charities, from any form \\n(“in the nature of ”) of activities that were trade, business or commerce, or engage \\nor involve in providing services in relation to trade, business or commerce - for a \\nfee, cess or other consideration. The inclusion of the term “ in the nature of ” was \\nby design, to clarify beyond doubt, that not only business, trade or commerce, but \\nall activities in the nature of, or resembling  them, were  proscribed. Likewise, \\nservice in relation to such activities, i.e. , services relating, or pertaining to, such \\nproscribed activities, too were forbidden.   \\n151. The reference to fee or cess, is in the opinion of the court, only to \\nemphasize that even a statutory consideration, for a service to business, trade or \\ncommerce, would take the activity outside the definition of a GPU charity.

To bring home this even more pointedly - and underline a break from the \\npast, the application of such amounts (received in the course of trade, commerce, \\nor business, or towards services in relation thereto) would be irrelevant , as \\nevidenced by the term “ irrespective ”, in the fourth limb of reading Section 2(15).  \\n \\nSummation of interpretation of Section 2(15)  \\n152. Section 2(15) - in the wake of its several amendments between 2008 and \\n2015 - can be juxtaposed with the interpretation of the unamended Section 2(15) \\nby this Court. In Surat Art Silk (supra), the principle enunciated was that so long \\nas the predominant ob ject of GPU category charity is charitable, its engagement \\nin a non -charitable object resulting in profits that are incidental, is permissible. \\nThe court also declared that profits and gains from such activities which were \\nnon-charitable had to be deployed  or “fed” back to achieve the dominant \\ncharitable object.  \\n153. The paradigm change achieved by Section 2(15) after its amendment in \\n2008 and as it stands today, is that firstly a GPU charity cannot engage in any \\nactivity in the nature of trade, commerce, b usiness or any service in relation to \\nsuch activities for any consideration (including a statutory fee etc.). This is \\nemphasized in the negative language employed by the main part of Section 2(15). \\nTherefore, the idea of a predominant object  among several other objects, is \\ndiscarded.

Section 12 -A prescribes the \\nconditions for applicability of Sections 11 and 12 of the Act.

The procedure for grant (or \\nrefusal) of registration is prescribed by Section 12AA. Section 13 enlists the \\ncircumstances under which tax exemption is unavailable to religious or charitable \\ntrusts otherwise falling under Se ctions 11 or 12.

It does not apply to cases where a \\ntrust or legal obligation is not created on any property, but only the income \\nderived from any particular property or source is set apart and charged for a \\ncharitable or religious purpose.  Similarly, when a business itself has been set \\naside for the objects of the trust, then such business is held under trust and will \\nfall under sub-section  (4).  However, where the profits of a business o f a trust are \\nappli ed for charitable purposes, then such business and trust will be governed by \\nsub-section  (4A).  \\n157. Section 11(1) of the Act exempts income derived from property held under \\ntrust wh olly for charitable or religious purposes, to the extent to which such \\nincome is applied to such purposes in India. The Act does not comprehensively \\ndefine \" property held under trust \". Section 11(4) however, provides that for the \\npurposes of Section 11, th e words \"property held under trust\" \"includes a \\nbusiness undertaking so held\".  Section 11(4A) as amended by the Finance (No. \\n2) Act, 1991 w.e.f. 01.04.1992 reads as under: - \\n\"(4A) Sub -section (1) or sub -section (2) or sub -section (3) or sub -section (3A) \\nshall not apply in relation to any income of a trust or an institution, being \\nprofits and gains of business, unless the business is incidental to the \\nattainment of the objectives of the trust or, as the case may be, institution, and \\nseparate books of account are maintained by such trust or institution in \\nrespect of such business.\"  \\n158.

In Gadodia \\nSwadeshi Stores v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Punj ab138, the Lahore High \\nCourt  held that the fact that the  business carried on behalf of the trust failed to \\nsatisfy the two conditions in Section 4(3)(ia) was no reason for it be denied \\nexemption if it fell within Section 4(3)(i). The court held that that th e two \\ncategories mentioned in the two clauses did not exclude each other.  \\n159.

Therefore, to summarise on the legal position on this - if a property is held \\nunder trust, and such property is a business, the case would fall under Section \\n11(4) and not under Section 11(4A) of the Act. Section 11(4A) of the Act, would \\napply only to a case where the business is not held under trust. There is a \\ndifference between a property or business held under trust and a business carried \\non by or on behalf of the trust. This distinction was recognized in Surat Art Silk  \\n(supra) , which observed that if a business undertaking is held under trust for a \\ncharitable purpose, the income from it would be entitled to exemption under \\nSection 11(1) of the Act.  \\n161. The interface between Sections 11(1) and (4) is of some importance. \\nFirstly , under Section 11(4), it is only the business which is held under the trust \\nthat would enjoy exemption in respect of its income under Section 11(1). \\nSecondly , there is a distinctio n between the objects of a trust and the powers given \\nto the trustees to effectuate the purposes of the trust. In this regard, the \\nobservations of this court, in J.K. Trust (supra) assume relevance. There, one of \\nthe questions which arose was whether the o ffice of managing agency , which was \\nan office of profit , was in fact settled upon trust and, therefore, could be \\nconsidered to be business held under trust. The court held that for the purposes of \\nSection 4(3)(i) of the 1922 Act, the office of managing age ncy was property \\nwhich could be held under trust. The revenue pointed out that on the terms of the \\ntrust deed previously executed by the settlors (on 15.06.1945 ), the properties \\nwhich the trustees are to hold and stand possessed of , were only the sum of \\n₹1,00,000/ -, any donations and contribution received by the trustees and all \\naccretions thereto , and investment in securities made from time to time \\nrepresenting the accretions .

It seems that the test applied in J.K. Trust  (supra) that for a business, to be \\nconsidered as property held under trust, it should have been either acquired with \\nthe help of the fund originally settled upon trust or the original fund settled upon \\ntrust must have a proximate connection with the later acquisit ion or carrying on \\nof the business by the trustees.

What then is the interpre tation of the expression “incidental” profits, from \\n“business” being “incidental to the attainment of the objectives” of the GPU \\ncharity  (which occurs in Section 11(4A) )? As stated earlier, the  interpretation of \\nthat expression in Thanthi  Trust (supra) was in the context of a per se charity, i.e. , \\nwhere the trust’s object was education. However, the restrictive or negative terms \\nenjoining GPU charities from carrying on profitable activity had been deleted in \\n1983  (w.e.f. 01.04.1984) . In Surat Art Silk  (supr a), the court had articulated the \\ndeterminative test for defining  whether a Trust was a GPU charity if its \\npredominant object was to carry out a charitable purpose and that if that was the \\ncase, the fact that it earned profit would not per se deprive it of  tax exemption. \\nThis decision was interpreted in the context of Section 11(4A) by this court in \\nThant hi Trust , to hold that business can be incidental to attainment of the trust’s \\nobjects.  \\n167. Thus, the journey which began with Surat Art  Silk was interpreted in \\nThant hi Trust to mean that the carrying on of business by GPU charity was \\npermissible as long as it inured to the benefit of the trust. The change brought \\nabout by the amendments in quest ions, however, place the focus on an entirely \\ndifferent perspective: that if at all any activity in the nature of trade , commerce \\nor business, or a service in the nature of the same,  for any form of consideration \\nis permissible, that activity should be int rinsically linked to, or a part of the GPU \\ncategory  charity’s object. Thus, the test of the charity being driven by a \\npredominant  object is no longer good law. Likewise, the ambiguity with respect \\nto the kind of activities generating profit which could fee d the main object and \\nincidental profit -making also is not good law.

Lastly, the \\n“ploughing” back of business income to “feed” charity is an irrelevant factor – \\nagain emphasizing the prohibition from engaging in trade, commerce or business.  \\n168.

The proper way of reading \\nreference to the term “incidental” in Section 11(4A) is to interpret it in the light \\nof the sub -clause (i) of proviso to S ection 2(15), i.e. , that the activity in the nature \\nof business, trade, commerce or service in relation to such activities should be \\nconducted actually in the course of achieving the GPU object , and  the income, \\nprofit or surplus or gains can then, be logic ally incidental . The amendment of \\n2016, inserting sub clause (i) to proviso to Section 2(15) was therefore \\nclarificatory.

The conclusion recorded above is also supported by the language of \\nseventh proviso142 to Section 10(23C). Whereas Section 2(15) is the definition \\nclause, Section 10 lists out what is not income .  Section 10(23C)  – by sub -clauses \\n(iv) and (v) exempt incomes of charitable organisations. Such organisations and \\ninstitutions are not limited to GPU category charities but rather extend to other \\ntypes of charities (i.e. the per se  kind as well). The controlling part of Section \\n10(23C) along with the relevant clauses (iv) and (v) seek to exclude income \\nreceived by the concerned charities. However, t he provisos hedge such exemption \\nwith conditions. The seventh proviso  - much like Section 11(4A) and the \\ndefinition  - carve out an exception, to the exemptions such that income derived \\nby charities from business, are not exempt. The seventh proviso virtual ly echoes \\nSection 11(4A) in that business income derived by a charity (in the present case, \\nthe GPU charities) which arises from an activity incidental to the attainment of \\nits objective is not per se excluded.  \\n170. Classically, the idea of charity was tie d up with eleemosynary143. However, \\n“charitable purpose” – and charity as defined in the Act have a wider meaning \\nwhere it is the object of the institution which is in focus. Thus, the idea of \\nproviding services or goods at no consideration, cost or nominal  consideration is \\nnot confined to the provision of services or goods without charging anything or \\ncharging a token or nominal amount.

Therefore, pure charity in the sense that the performance of an activity \\nwithout any consideration  is not envisioned under the Act. If one keeps this in \\nmind, what Section 2(15) emphasizes is that so long as a GPU’s charity’s object \\ninvolves activities whi ch also generates profits ( incidental , or in other words, \\nwhile actually  carrying  out the objectives of GPU, if some profit is generated), it \\ncan be granted  exemption provided the quantitative limit  (of not exceeding 20%)  \\nunder second proviso to Section 2( 15) for receipts from such profits, is adhered \\nto. \\n172.

The effect of the \\nseventeenth proviso to Section 10(23C) is to impose the same condition i.e. , that \\nthat the trade, commerce or business activity or service relating to trade, business \\nor commerce, should be part of the GPU’s activities, to achieve its object of \\nadvancing general public utility.  The other condition – which is drawn i n as part \\nof the exemption condition, is that if such trading or commercial activity takes \\nplace the receipts should be confined to a prescribed percentage of the overall \\nreceipts.

The Board ceas ed \\nto enjoy exemption which it had hitherto, in the absence of the retrospective \\ndefinition. It, therefore sought exemption, as a GPU category charity claiming \\nthat it was controlled by objects of general public utility having regard to the \\nprovisions of i ts parent Act, i.e. , the Gujarat Maritime Board Act. This court \\nrefuted the argument of the revenue that if a corporation did not fall within the \\ndefinition of “local authority” it could not claim to be a GPU charity. It was held \\nthat Section 10(20) and Se ction 11 of the 1961 Act operate in totally different \\nspheres. Even if the Board is not considered as a local authority, it is not precluded \\nfrom claiming exemption under Section 11(1) of the 1961 Act. Therefore, the \\ncourt read Section 11(1) in light of th e definition of the words “charitable \\npurposes” as defined under Section 2(15). This court also relied upon the ruling \\nin CIT v.

This restriction has been introduced for the first time [as that prohibition \\nwas absent in the now repealed Section 10 (20A)] . \\n182.

Then, dealing wit h the term \\n“commercial activity” under Section 10(46), it was held that the decisive test is \\nwhether the activities for which consideration in the form of fee, service charge \\netc., is collected, is “ intrinsically associated, connected and had minimum nexus  \\nwith the object of regulating and administering the activity for the benefit of the \\npublic ”.  \\n184.

The construction of buildings, the establishment of \\nindustries by letting buildings on hire or sale, the acquisition and transfer of \\nland in relation to establishment of industrial estate or development of \\nindustrial areas and of setting up of industries cannot be said to be dealing \\nin land or buildings for the obvious reason that the State is carry ing out the \\nobjects of the Act with the Corporation as an agent in setting up industries in \\nthe State. The Act aims at building an industrial town and the Corporation \\ncarries out the objects of the Act. The hard core of a trading Corporation is \\nits commerc ial character. Commerce connotes transactions of purchase and \\nsale of commodities, dealing in goods. The forms of business transactions \\nmay be varied but the real character is buying and selling.

There is a two -fold distinction between the now -deleted Section 10(20A) \\nand the newly added Section 10(46) (w.e.f. 01.06.2011) . Firstly, that the erstwhile \\nSection 10(20A) applied to a limited class of undertaking i.e., the bodies, or \\ncorporations, constituted by or under any law -confined to the planning and \\ndevelopment of housing infrastructure.  However, the newly added Section \\n10(46) is wider in comparison and the activities of any body or authority or board \\nconstituted by or under any central or State Act with “ the object of regulating or \\nadministering any activity for the benefit of the general public ”, has broader \\nimport. In a sense, t he newly added Section 10(46), resembles a GPU category \\ncharity classified under Section 2(15).  The second distinction is that Section \\n10(20A) did not bar any board, or corporations , etc. from indulging in commercial \\nactivities. However, sub -clause (b) of  Section 10(46) imposes such a bar, and the \\nconcerned body cannot claim tax exemption if it engages in commercial activity.   \\n188. The manner in which GPU charities has been dealt with under the \\ndefinition clause, i.e., Section 2(15), indicates that even t hough trading or \\ncommercial activity or service in relation to trade, commerce or business appears \\nto be barred  – nevertheless the ban is lifted somewhat by the proviso which \\nenables such activities to be carried out if they are intrinsically  part of the a ctivity \\nof achieving the object of general public utility.  Furthermore, in the case of GPU \\ncharities there is a quantified limit of the overall receipts, which is permissible \\nfrom such commercial activity.  In the case of local authorities and corporation s \\ncovered by Section 10(46) no such activities are seemingly permitted.  \\n189. As was observed in the earlier part of this judgment – while considering \\nwhether for the period 01.0.2003 - 31.05.2011, statutory boards, corporations , etc. \\ncould have lawfully c laimed to be GPU charities, this court has observed that the \\nnature of such corporations is not to generate profit but to make available goods \\nand other services for the benefit of public weal.

The Revenue has appealed the decision of Delhi High Court in which the \\nNational Internet Exchange of India (NIXI) was held to b e a GPU category \\ncharity. The materials on record show that NIXI was established in 2003 under \\nthe aegis of the Ministry of Information Technology of the Union Government \\nfor the promotion and growth of internet services in India , to regulate the internet \\ntraffic , act as an internet exchange , and undertake “.in” domain name registration . \\nConcededly, NIXI, is a not for profit, and is barred from undertaking any \\ncommercial or business activity.  Its object is to promote the interest s of internet \\nservice providers and internet consumers in India, improve quality of internet \\nservice , save foreign exchange , and carry  on domain name operati ons.  It is bound \\nby licensing conditions – which include the prohibition from altering its \\nmemorandum , without the prior consent of the Union Government.  According \\nto the submissions made on NIXI’s behalf, it charges annual membership fee of \\n₹1000/ - and registration of second and third level domain names at ₹500/- and \\n₹250/-.  The finding of the ITAT and the High Court are that NIXI ’s objects and \\nfunctioning are by way of general public utility and thus it is a GPU category \\ncharity.  \\n210. Having regard to  the findings on record and the materials placed by the \\nparties, it is evident that NIXI carries on the essential – crucial purpose of \\npromoting internet services and more important ly, regulating domain name \\nregistration  which is extremely  essential for in ternet users in India. A country’s \\nneed to have a domestic internet exchange, rather than depend on an international \\none, cannot be overemphasized.  The Union Government’s object of setting up of \\ninternet exchange is part of its essential function as a gove rnment to regulate \\ncertain segment of the communication networks.  In the absence of a single entity \\nauthorized to register “.in” domain names, there is bound to be chaos or \\nconfusion.

In respect of revenues from sale of media rights, an arrangement has \\nevolved over tim e. Until 1991 -92 the income from media rights was meager. \\nWith the growth in income from media rights, it became necessary to optimize \\nthe arrangement for sale of media rights. For a Test series or ODI series \\nconducted in multiple centers and organised by BCCI and multiple state \\nassociations, it was found that if each state association were to negotiate the \\nsale of rights to events in its centre, its negotiating strength would be low. It \\nwas, therefore, agreed that BCCI would negotiate the sale of media rig hts for \\nthe entire country to optimize the income under this head. It was further \\ndecided that out of the receipts from the sale of media rights 70% of the gross \\nrevenue less production cost would belong to the state associations. Every \\nyear, BCCI has paid  out exactly 70% of its receipts from media rights (less - \\nproduction cost) to the state associations. This amount has been utilized by \\nthe respective associations to build infrastructure and promote cricket, \\nmaking the game more popular, nurturing and enco uraging cricket talent, \\nand leading to higher revenues from media rights.  \\n*************      ****************  \\nEven in the event that exemption under section 11 is denied, the payments to \\nstate associations must be allowed as a deduction, as expenditure laid  out or \\nexpended wholly and exclusively for the purpose of earning such income, it \\nmust be appreciated that in order to earn revenues, BCCI was and continues \\nto be highly dependent on the state associations. BCCI does not have the \\ninfrastructure and the re sources to conduct the matches by itself and is \\ndependent on the state associations to conduct the matches. The income from \\nmedia rights is dependent on the efforts of the state associations in conducting \\nthe matches from which the media rights accrue. The  division of revenues and \\nexpenditure is a matter of arrangement between the parties. Certain incomes \\nsuch as sale of ticket revenues belong to the state associations, who meet the \\nexpenditure on the matches such as security for players and spectators \\ntemp orary stands, operation of floodlights, Score Boards, management of \\ncrowd, insurance for the match, electricity charges, catering etc. Whereas \\nwith regard to the income from sale of media rights, the arrangement between ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The ITAT accepted the assesse e’s contentions, and held that the \\nassociations were GPU charities:  \\n“35. Let us take a pause here and examine as to what are the activities of the \\nassessee cricket associations so as to be brought within the ambit of trade, \\ncommerce or business. We have se en objects of the association, which are \\nreproduced earlier in our order, and it is not even the case of the revenue \\nthat these objects have anything to do with any trade, commerce or business; \\nthese objects are simply to promote cricket. The trigger for i nvoking proviso \\nto Section 2(15), as Shri Soparkar rightly contends, has to an activity of the \\nassessee which is in the nature of trade, commerce or business. However, \\nthe case of the revenue authorities hinges on the allegation that the way and \\nmanner in which cricket matches are being organized, particularly the IPL \\nmatches, the activity of organizing cricket matches is nothing but brute \\ncommerce. Undoubtedly, it would appear that right from the time Kerry \\nPacker started his World Series Cricket in 1977, there has been no looking \\nback in commercialization of cricket and the impact of this \\ncommercialization has not left Indian cricket intact. The Indian Premier \\nLeague and the rules of the game being governed by the dictates of \\ncommercial considerations may seem to be one such example of \\ncommercialization of Indian cricket. The difficulty for the case of the revenue \\nbefore us, however, is that these matches are not being organized by the local \\ncricket associations. We are told that the matches are being organ ized by the \\nBoard of Cricket Control of India, but then, if we are to accept this claim \\nand invoke the proviso to Section 2(15) for this reason, it will amount to a \\nsituation in which proviso to Section 2(15) is being invoked on account of \\nactivities of an  entity other than the assessees - something which law does not \\npermit. We are not really concerned, at this stage, whether the allegations \\nabout commercialization of cricket by the BCCI are correct or not, because \\nthat aspect of the matter would be relevan t only for the purpose of proviso \\nto Section 2(15) being invoked in the hands of the BCCI. We do not wish to \\ndeal with that aspect of the matter or to make any observations which would \\nprejudge the case of the BCCI. Suffice to say that the very foundation of \\nrevenue's case is devoid of legally sustainable basis for the short reason that \\nthe commercialization of cricket by the BCCI, even if that be so, cannot be \\nreason enough to invoke the proviso to Section 2(15). We are alive o learned \\nCommissioner (DR)'s suggestion that the cricket associations cannot be seen \\non standalone basis as the BCCI is nothing but an apex body of these cricket \\nassociations at a collective level and whatever BCCI does is at the behest of \\nor with the connivance of the local cricket a ssociations, and that it is not the \\ncase that anyone can become a Member of the BCCI because only a \", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We are \\nalso alive to learned Commissioner\\'s argument that what is being sought to \\nbe protect ed by the charitable status of these associations is the share of \\nthese cricket associations from the commercial profits earned by the BCCI \\nby organizing the cricket matches. The problem, however, is that the \\nactivities of the apex body, as we have explain ed earlier, cannot be reason \\nenough to trigger proviso to Section 2(15) in these cases. Whether these \\ncricket associations collectively constitute BCCI or not, in the event of BCCI \\nbeing involved in commercial activities, the taxability of such commercial \\nprofits will arise in the hands of the BCCI and not the end beneficiaries. Even \\nin such a case the point of taxability of these profits is the BCCI and not the \\ncricket associations, because, even going by learned Commissioner\\'s \\narguments, these receipts in  the hands of the cricket associations is nothing \\nbut appropriation of profits. What can be taxed is accrual of profits and not \\nappropriation of profits. In any event, distinction between the cricket \\nassociations and the BCCI cannot be ignored for the purp oses of tax \\ntreatment. There is no dispute that the matches were organized by the BCCI, \\nand the assessee cannot thus be faulted for the commercial considerations \\nsaid to be inherent in planning the matches. As we make these observations, \\nand as we do not h ave the benefit of hearing the perspective of the BCCI, we \\nmake it clear that these observations will have no bearing on any \\nadjudication in the hands of the BCCI. Suffice to say that so far as the cricket \\nassociations are concerned, the allegations of the  revenue authorities have \\nno bearing on the denial of the status of \\'charitable activities\\' in the hands \\nof the cricket associations before us - particularly as learned Commissioner \\nhas not been able to point out a single object of the assessee cricket \\nassociations which is in the nature of trade, commerce or business, and, as \\nit is not even in dispute that the objects being pursued by the assessee cricket \\nassociations are \"objects of general public utility\" under section 2(15).

It was sought \\nto be urged that the activity of sports and sport promotion is basically education , \\nand hence, per se  exempt. Realizing the value of inculcating sportsmanship and \\nfostering the culture of sport, Parliament had introduced Section 10(23), to \\nexempt income received by sports bodies. However, that was deleted w.e.f. \\n01.04.2003. It was argued that this does no t preclude sports bodies, like cricket \\nassociations from claiming to be charities.

The game of competitive cricket, at the organizational level is structured \\nin such a manner that BCCI has  umbilical ties with the state associations. Not \\nonly are the latter, the members who constitute BCCI and elect its governing \\nbodies, they also own vital infrastructure necessary to play cricket: such as stadia, \\nand all related facilities. BCCI does not own those facilities or infrastructure  and \\ndepends on them . Furthermore, the state associations are the channels through \\nwhich players are  mostly selected, and get opportunities to participate in state, \\nnational and international level cricket.  \\n228. As things stand, therefore, the state associations and BCCI are linked \\nclosely. The management of the game of cricket is structured in such a way that \\nthis link is apparent at every match or fixture of significance. In the course of \\nconducting matches (which are scheduled by the BCCI as the national co -\\nordinating body), apart from amounts received towards sale of entry tickets, the \\nstate association s also receive advertisement money, sponsorship fee, etc. from \\nthe BCCI. Aside from these, media rights - i.e., broadcasting rights to each \\nnational or international event conducted at various locales owned by the state \\nassociations, and digital rights (al l of which are exclusive , in nature) - are \\nauctioned by BCCI. As noticed above, the BCCI, by its own admission, \\nnegotiates the terms on which media rights are sold, on behalf of the state \\nassociations:  \\n“For a Test series or ODI series conducted in multiple  centers and \\norganised by BCCI and multiple state associations, it was found that if each \\nstate association were to negotiate the sale of rights to events in its centre, \\nits negotiating strength would be low. It was, therefore, agreed that BCCI \\nwould negot iate the sale of media rights for the entire country to optimize \\nthe income under this head. It was further decided that out of the receipts \\nfrom the sale of media rights 70% of the gross revenue less production cost \\nwould belong to the state associations.  Every year, BCCI has paid out \\nexactly 70% of its receipts from media rights (less - production cost) to the \\nstate associations. This amount has been utilized by the respective \\nassociations to build infrastructure and promote cricket, making the game \\nmore p opular, nurturing and encouraging cricket talent, and leading to \\nhigher revenues from media rights.”  \\n ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

On a close scrutiny of the expenses borne, ha ving regard to the nature of \\nreceipts, the expenditure incurred by Cricket Associations does not disclose that \\nany significant  proportion is expended  towards sustained or organized coaching \\ncamps or academies. Therefore, in the opinion of this court, the I TAT fell into \\nerror in not considering the nature of receipts flowing from the BCCI into the \\ncorpus of GCA and SCA – as well as other associations that are before this court - \\nto determine their true character. The ITAT appears to have been swayed by the \\nsubmission that the amount given by the BCCI were towards capital subsidy.  \\n236. To determine whether a given receipt is to be characterized as falling in the \\nrevenue or capital stream, the objective for which it is given as well as the manner \\nin which it is utilized has to be scrutinized. This aspect has been highlighted in \\nSahney Ste el & Press Works Ltd v. Commissioner of Income Tax155 in the \\nfollowing terms:  \\n“It is not the source from which the amount is paid to the assessee which is \\ndeterminative of the question whether the subsidy payments are of revenue or \\ncapital nature. The first  proposition stated by Viscount Simon in  Ostime \\ncase [28 TC 261 : (1946) 1 All ER 668] is that if payments in the nature of \\nsubsidy from public funds are made to the assessee to assist him in carrying \\non his trade or business, they are trade receipts.”  \\n \\nThis has later been followed in  Commissioner of Income Tax v. Ponni \\nSugars156. \\n237. Recent trends have shown that media rights, especially broadcasting and \\ndigital media rights have yielded colossal revenues to the BCCI.

According to the BCCI itself, the State \\nAssociations can well bargain and enter into arrangements for the sale of such \\nmedia rights. However, to obtain better terms, and ga in bargaining leverage a \\ncentralized form of sale of such rights has been agreed and adopted by which the \\nBCCI auctions these rights on behalf of the State Associations. All State \\nAssociations put together are entitled to 70% of the revenue – i.e., the pro ceeds \\nof sale of the media rights. This may or may not be in proportion to the events \\nhosted by each or some of the cricket associations. Yet, this forms part of the \\narrangement by which the consideration flowing from such commercial rights has \\nbeen agreed  to be shared amongst all members of the BCCI.

In the light of these, the Court is of the opinion that the ITAT – as well as \\nthe High Court fell into error in accepting at face value the submission that the \\namou nts made over by BCCI to the cricket associations were in the nature of \\ninfrastructure subsidy.

It goes without saying that there need not be an exact correlation or \\na proportionate division between the receipt and the actual expenditure. This is in \\nline with the principle that what is an adequate c onsideration for something which \\nis agreed upon by parties is a matter best left to them.

The Tribune Trust was constituted pursuant to a will executed by late \\nSardar Dial Singh Majithia. In clause (xxi) of his Will – after nominating three \\ntrustees, the testator directed that they ought to maintain a press and a newspaper; \\nin clause (xx) the testator directed that his property in the Tribune Press and \\nnewspaper would vest permanently in a Committee of Trustees who would \\nthereafter maintain them and “ keep up the liberal policy of the newspaper and \\nactivity and the excess income after curren t expenses in improving the said \\nnewspaper and place it on a footing of permanency” . \\n240. Under the old Act, a question arose as to whether the activity of running a \\nnewspaper was one of general public utility; the revenue disallowed the \\nexemption for AY 1 932-33. This was affirmed by the Lahore High Court. The \\nPrivy Council by its decision in In Re: Trustees of Tribune (supra)  allowed the \\ntrust’s appeal and held that the trust was neither constituted for private profit \\neither to the testator nor to any othe r private person , and that the object of the \\npaper could be described as one “ supplying the province with an organ of \\neducated public opinion ”.

The assessee  is a registered society which was formed with the object of \\nestablishing and running a health club, Arogya Kendra; its object in cluded \\norganization of emergency relief centres , etc. Other objects, included promotion \\nof moral values, eradication of child labour, dowry , etc. The assessee had entered \\ninto arrangements with the state agencies to supply mid -day meals to students of \\nprim ary schools in different villages through contracts entered into with the Basic \\nShiksha Adhikari, District Meerut. It is a matter of record that the materials for \\npreparation of mid -day meal was supplied by the government. The assessee \\nsociety claimed that  it only obtains nominal charges for preparation of mid -day \\nmeals. The assessee’s claim for registration was rejected on the ground that it was \\ninvolved in commercial activity. Upon appeal, the ITAT agreed with the assessee \\nthat supply of mid -day meals did  not constitute business or commerce and that it \\npromoted the objects of general public utility.  \\n249. The revenue in its appeal contends that the assessee’s only activity for the \\nrelevant year was supply of mid -day meals to primary schools. This was not \\nrelatable to any object of the society. The assessee’s contention is that the state \\nordinarily would have carried on the activity of supply of mid -day meals. Yet, \\nnevertheless it outsourced its activity to an outside agency like the assessee which \\nperformed  it for nominal charges.  \\n250.

Summation of conclusions  \\n253.

General test under Section 2(15)  \\nA.1. It is clarified that an assessee advancing general public utility cannot \\nengage itself in any trade, commerce or business , or provide service in relation \\nthereto for any consideration (“cess, or fee, or any other consideration”);  \\nA.2. However, in the course of achieving the object of general public utility, the \\nconcerned trust, society, or other such organization, can carry o n trade, commerce \\nor business or provide services in relation thereto for consideration, provided that \\n(i) the activities of trade, commerce or business are connected  (“actual carrying \\nout…” inserted w.e.f. 01.04.2016) to the achievement of its objects of GPU; and \\n(ii) the receipt from such business or commercial activity or service in relation \\nthereto, does not exceed the quantified limit, as amended over the years (Rs. 10 \\nlakhs w.e.f. 01.04.2009 ; then Rs. 25 lakhs w.e.f. 01.04.2012 ; and now 20% of \\ntotal r eceipts of the previous year , w.e.f. 01.04.2016);  \\nA.3. Generally, the charging of any amount towards consideration for such an \\nactivity ( advancing  general public utility), which is on cost -basis or nominally \\nabove cost, cannot be considered to be “trade, c ommerce, or business” or any \\nservices in relation thereto. It is only when the charges are markedly or \\nsignificantly above the cost incurred by the asse ssee in question, that they would \\nfall within the mischief of “cess, or fee, or any other consideration”  towards \\n“trade, commerce or business”.

Section 11(4A) must be interpreted harmoniously with Section 2(15), with \\nwhich there is no conflict. Carrying out activity in the nature of trade, commerce \\nor business, or service in relation to such activities, should be conducted i n the \\ncourse of achieving the GPU object, and the income, profit or surplus or gains \\nmust, therefore, be incidental . The requirement in Section 11(4A) of maintaining \\nseparate books of account is also in line with the necessity of demonstrating that \\nthe qua ntitative limit prescribed in the proviso to Section 2(15), has not been \\nbreached. Similarly, the insertion of Section 13(8), seventeenth proviso to Section \\n10(23 C) and third proviso to Section 143(3) (all w.r.e.f. 01.04.2009), reaffirm this \\ninterpretation  and bring uniformity across the statutory provisions.  \\nB.
