Religious and charitable trusts have existed in one form or the other, tracing \ntheir origins to the instinct of benevolence, which is part of human nature.  Indian \nphilanthropy has enriched its cultural heritage, particu larly in catering to the \neducational, medical, socio -economic, and religious needs of the people. Here its \nrole has been supplementary to the efforts of the State, which has recognized the \npublic utility of this impulse, and granted tax exemptions.  Indian income -tax laws \nhave favoured charities, even granted preferential treatment since 1886. The law, \nwhile granting exemption to income from religious and charitable  trusts has taken \neffective measures to minimise misuse of trust funds. As a result, a \ncharita ble trust loses tax exemption if certain provisions are not complied with, \nand if its activities  do not fall under Section 10 of the Act . Such trusts also have \nto apply their income to the charitable  objects within a specified period, maintain \nproper audited accounts, and invest or utilise funds in a manner so that no benefit \nis derived by the settlor, trustees, their relatives, or other persons.1  \n3.

The then Finance Minister , Mr. Morarji Desai, explained the rationale for \nthe new definition  on the floor of Lok Sabha:  \n\u201cThe definition of \u2018charitable purpose\u2019 in that clause is at presen t so widely \nworded that it can be taken advantage of even by commercial concerns which, \nwhile ostensibly serving a public purpose, get fully paid for the benefits \nprovided by them, namely, the newspaper industry which while running its \nconcern on commercia l line can claim that by circulating newspapers it was \nimproving the general knowledge of the public. In order to prevent the misuse \nof this definition in such cases, the Select Committee felt that the words \u2018not \ninvolving the carrying on of any activity f or profit\u2019 should be added to the \ndefinition. \u201d11 \n \n11. The first major decision to interpret the new definition was Sole Trustee, \nLok Shikshana Trust  v. Commissioner of Income Tax12 (hereafter \u201c Lok Shikshana \nTrust \u201d). This court turned down a contention that newspaper business, carried on \nwith several other objects (which included setting up of educational institutions, \ndissemination of knowledge to the Kannada speaking public through newspaper, \netc.) was charitable. The court noticed  the chang ed definition :  \n\u201c7.\u2026The result thus of the change in the definition is that in order to bring a \ncase within the fourth category of charitable purpose, it would be necessary \nto show that (1) the purpose of the trust is the advancement of any other object \nof general public utility, and (2) the above purpose does not involve the \ncarrying on of any activity for profit. Both the above conditions must be \nfulfilled before the purpose of the trust can be held to be charitable purpose.  \n* * *  \n9. It is true t hat there are some business activities like mutual insurance and \nco-operative stores of which profit -making is not an essential ingredient, but \nthat is so because of a self -imposed and innate restriction on making profit in \nthe carrying on of that particul ar type of business.  Ordinarily profit motive is \na normal incidence of business activity and if the activity of a trust consists \nof carrying on of a business and there are no restrictions on its making profit, \nthe court would be well justified in assuming in the absence of some indication \nto the contrary that the object of the trust involves the carrying on of an \nactivity for profit\u2026\u2026.. By the use of the expression \u2018profit motive\u2019 it is not \nintended that profit must in fact be earned. Nor does the expressio n cover a \nmere desire to make some monetary gain out of a transaction or even a series \n \n\nCitations:\n11 (LVI)  Lok Sabha Debates. , 32nd scs., p. 3073 (August 18, 1961).\n12 (1976) 1 SCC 254  (hereafter \u201c Lok Shikshana Trust \u201d)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 2756, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "791f1ef7-be7a-4e08-8627-f1976546a657": {"__data__": {"id_": "791f1ef7-be7a-4e08-8627-f1976546a657", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\NIPL2093\\work\\long_doc_summarization\\data\\37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1022428, "creation_date": "2024-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6bbe7332-1acd-42c3-bbd4-e5f3e7e21085", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\NIPL2093\\work\\long_doc_summarization\\data\\37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1022428, "creation_date": "2024-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-20"}, "hash": "9202cb2264476e90320f04d8bb95c1a9a2b0b4dd43ebf911a7068573bb567ef2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "of transactions.

Even if (a) and (b) \nare answered affirmatively, if (c)(i) is answered affirmatively, the claim for \nexemption collapses. The solution to the problem of an activity being \none for or irrespective of profit is gathered on a footing of facts. What is the  \nreal nature of the activity? One which is ordinarily carried on by ordinary \npeople for gain? Is there a built -in prescription in the constitution against \nmaking a profit? Has there been in practice, profit from this venture? \nAlthough, this last is a weak test.

It is the object of general public utility whi ch must not \ninvolve the carrying on of any activity for profit and not its advancement or \nattainment. What is inhibited by these last ten words is the linking of activity \nfor profit with the object of general public utility and not its linking with the \naccomplishment or carrying out of the object. It is not necessary that the \naccomplishment of the object or the means to carry out the object should not \ninvolve an activity for profit. That is not the mandate of the newly added \nwords. What these words require is that the object should not involve the \ncarrying on of any activity for profit. The emphasis is on the object of general \npublic utility and not on its accomplishment or attainment. The decisions of \nthe Kerala and Andhra Pradesh High Courts in  CIT v.

Now there are two possible ways of looking at this \nproblem of construction. One interpretation is that according to the definition \nwhat is n ecessary is that the purpose must be of such a nature that it involves \nthe carrying on of any activity for profit in the sense that it cannot be achieved \nwithout carrying on an activity for profit. On this view, if the purpose can be \nachieved without the t rust or institution engaging itself in an activity for \nprofit, it cannot be said that the purpose involves the carrying on of an activity \nfor profit\u2026  \n******************      **************  \n16. The other interpretation is to see whether the purpose of the t rust or \ninstitution in fact involves the carrying on of an activity for profit or in other \nwords whether an activity for profit is actually carried on as an integral part \nof the purpose or to use the words of Chandrachud, J, as he then was \nin Dharmodayam c ase [(1977) 4 SCC 75] , \u201cas a matter of advancement of \nthe purpose\u201d. There must be an activity for profit and it must be involved in \ncarrying out the purpose of the trust or institution or to put it differently, it \nmust be carried on in order to advance th e purpose or in the course of \ncarrying out the purpose of the trust or institution. It is then that the inhibition \nof the exclusionary clause would be attracted. This appears to us to be a more \nplausible construction which gives meaning and effect to the l ast concluding \nwords added by the legislature and we prefer to accept it. Of course, there is \none qualification which must be mentioned here and it is that if the \nconstitution of a trust or institution expressly provides that the purpose shall \nbe carried o ut by engaging in an activity which has a predominant profit \nmotive, as, for example, where the purpose is specifically stated to be \npromotion of sports by holding cricket matches on commercial lines with a \nview to making profit, there would be no scope fo r controversy, because the \npurpose would, on the face of it, involve carrying on of an activity for profit \nand it would be non -charitable even though no activity for profit is actually \ncarried on or, in the example given, no cricket matches are in fact org anised.  \n17. The next question that arises is as to what is the meaning of the \nexpression \u201cactivity for profit\u201d. Every trust or institution must have a purpose \nfor which it is established and every purpose must for its accomplishment \ninvolve the carrying on  of an activity. The activity must, however, be for profit \nin order to attract the exclusionary clause and the question therefore is when \ncan an activity be said to be one  for profit? The answer to the question \nobviously depends on the correct connotation of the preposition \u201cfor\u201d. This \npreposition has many shades of meaning but when used with the active \nparticiple of a verb it means \u201cfor the purpose of\u201d and connotes the end with \nreference to which something is done. It is not therefore enough that as a \nmatter of fact an activity results in profit but it must be carried on with the \nobject of earning profit. Profit -making must be the end to which the activity \nmust be directed or in other words, the predominant object of the activity must \nbe making a profit. Wh ere an activity is not pervaded by profit motive but is \ncarried on primarily for serving the charitable purpose, it would not be \ncorrect to describe it as an activity for profit. But where, on the other hand, \nan activity is carried on with the predominant object of earning profit, it \nwould be an activity for profit, though it may be carried on in advancement \nof the charitable purpose of the trust or institution.

The court took note of the judgment of Pathak, J. in  Dharmadeepti  v. CIT17  \nas well as the speech of then then Finance Minister, and further observed:   \n\u201c17. \u2026.It is obvious that the exclusionary clause was added with a view to \novercoming the decision of the Privy Council in the  Tribune case  [AIR 1939 \nPC 208: In Re the T rustees of the Tribune, (1939) 7 ITR 415] where it was \nheld that the object of supplying the community with an organ of educated \npublic opinion by publication of a newspaper was an object of general public \nutility and hence charitable in character, even th ough the activity of \npublication of the newspaper was carried on commercial lines with the object \nof earning profit. The publication of the newspaper was an activity engaged \nin by the trust for the purpose of carrying out its charitable purpose and on \nthe facts it was clearly an activity which had profit making as its predominant \nobject, but even so it was held by the Judicial Committee that since the \npurpose served was an object of general public utility, it was a charitable \npurpose. It is clear from the s peech of the Finance Minister that it was with a \nview to setting at naught this decision that the exclusionary clause was added \nin the definition of \u201ccharitable purpose\u201d. The test which has, therefore, now \nto be applied is whether the predominant object of  the activity involved in \ncarrying out the object of general public utility is to subserve the charitable \npurpose or to earn profit. Where profit making is the predominant object of \nthe activity, the purpose, though an object of general public utility, wou ld \ncease to be a charitable purpose. But where the predominant object of the \nactivity is to carry out the charitable purpose and not to earn profit, it would \nnot lose its character of a charitable purpose merely because some profit \narises from the activity . The exclusionary clause does not require that the \nactivity must be carried on in such a manner that it does not result in any \nprofit. It would indeed be difficult for persons in charge of a trust or \ninstitution to so carry on the activity that the expend iture balances the income \nand there is no resulting profit\u2026..  \n \n18.

The Constitution Bench disagreed with the approach in both \nthe previous judgments, and observed:  \n\u201c19. \u2026Now we entirely agree with the learned Judges who decided these two \ncases that activity involved in carrying out the charitable purpose must not \nbe motivated by a profit objective but it must be undertaken for the purpose \nof advancement or carrying out of the charitable purpose. But we find it \ndifficult to accept their thesis that whenever an activity is carried on which  \nyields profit, the inference must necessarily be drawn, in the absence of some \nindication to the contrary, that the activity is  for profit and the charitable \npurpose involves the carrying on of an activity for profit. We do not think the \nCourt would be ju stified in drawing any such inference merely because the \nactivity results in profit. It is in our opinion not at all necessary that there \nmust be a provision in the constitution of the trust or institution that the \nactivity shall be carried on no profit no  loss basis or that profit shall be \nproscribed. Even if there is no such express provision, the nature of the \ncharitable purpose, the manner in which the activity for advancing the \ncharitable purpose is being carried on and the surrounding circumstances \nmay clearly indicate that the activity is not propelled by a dominant profit \nmotive. What is necessary to be considered is whether having regard to all \nthe facts and circumstances of the case, the dominant object of the activity is \nprofit making or carrying out a charitable purpose. If it is the former, the \npurpose would not be a charitable purpose, but, if it is the latter, the \ncharitable character of the purpose would not be lost.   \n20. If we apply this test in the present case, it is clear that the activity  of \nobtaining licences for import of foreign yarn and quotas for purchase of \nindigenous yarn, which was carried on by the assessee, was not an activity \nfor profit. The predominant object of this activity was promotion of commerce \nand trade in Art Silk Yarn , Raw Silk, Cotton Yarn, Art Silk Cloth, Silk Cloth \nand Cotton Cloth, which was clearly an object of general public utility and \nprofit was merely a bye -product which resulted incidentally in the process of \ncarrying out the charitable purpose. It is signifi cant to note that the assessee \nwas a Company recognised by the Central Government under Section 25 of \nthe Companies Act, 1956 and under its Memorandum of Association, the \nprofit arising from any activity carried on by the assessee was liable to be \napplied solely and exclusively for the promotion of trade and commerce in \nvarious commodities which we have mentioned above and no part of such \nprofit could be distributed amongst the members in any form or under any \nguise.

For the third period  (1992 -93 to 1996 -97), the court dealt wit h the meaning \nand effect of Section 11(4A) (amended and substituted w.e.f. 01.04.1992) and \nheld that the assessee trust was entitled to be treated as a charity:  \n\u201c25. The substituted sub -section (4A) states that the income derived from a \nbusiness held under  Trust wholly for charitable or religious purposes shall \nnot be included in the total income of the previous year of the Trust or \ninstitution if \"the business is incidental to the attainment of the objective of \nthe Trust or, as the case may be, institution \" and separate books of account \nare maintained in respect of such business. Clearly, the scope of sub -section \n(4A) is more beneficial to a Trust or institution than was the scope of sub -\nsection (4A) as originally enacted. In fact, it seems to us that the s ubstituted \nsub-section (4A) gives Trust or institution a greater benefit than was given by \nsection 13(1)(bb). If the object of Parliament was to give Trusts and \ninstitutions no more benefit than that given by section 13(1)(bb), the language \nof section 13(1 )(bb) would have been employed in the substituted sub -section \n(4A). As it stands, all that it requires for the business income of a Trust or \ninstitution to be exempt is that the business should be incidental to the \nattainment of the objectives of the Trust  or institution. A business whose \nincome is utilized by the Trust or the institution for the purposes of achieving \nthe objectives of the Trust or the institution is, surely, a business which is \nincidental to the attainment of the objectives of the Trust . In any event, if there \nbe any ambiguity in the language employed, the provision must be construed \nin a manner that benefits the assessee. The Trust, therefore, is entitled to the \nbenefit of section 11 for the assessment year 1992 -93 and thereafter.

Those decisions cons equently did not rule out \ncarrying on of activities akin to business, by charitable institutions established to \nadvance general public utility.  \n29. The ASG next submitted that Parliament\u2019s intent, in changing the law, wa s \nto expressly forbid  the tax exemption benefit if the entity was \u201cinvolved\u201d in \ncarrying on trade or business. The revenue relied on the two decisions in  Lok \nShikshana Trust , and Indian Chamber of Commerce  (supra) , highlighting that the \nsignificance of the change \u2013 brought about by  Section 2(15) of the IT Act \u2013 was \nnoticed. Particular reliance was placed on the observations of Beg, J in Lok \nShikshana Trust and the passages in Indian Chamber of Commerce to urge that \nthe involvement of an entity in the carrying on of activities for pr ofit, even if for \nadvancement of  charitable purpose or object, disentitl ed it to tax exemption . The \nlearned ASG urged that this court  had recognized \u2013 from its earlier decisions \u2013 \nthat the prohibition from carrying on trade or commerce activities applied o nly to \ncharities meant to advance general public utility and not the other categories such \nas education, medical relief , or relief to the poor (which are per se exempt).  \n30. The ASG submitted that the judgments in Indian Chamber of Commerce \nand Lok Shiksha na Trust  (supra) were conscious of the generality  of the GPU \ncategory  which led Parliament to insert the restrictive words \"not involving the \ncarrying on of any activity for profit \u201d. It was argued  that Parliament amended  the \ndefinition due to rampant abuse of the law by businesses  claiming to be driven by \ncharitable purposes.  Often, charities would be created merely to secure exemption \nfrom tax, and would carry on large commercial activities, enjoying the profits . \nThis led Par liament to embed the exclusionary terms, depriving exemption if the \ninstitution otherwise fell under the GPU category  charity, but undertook activities \nfor profit.

The Select \nCommittee of Parliament (at that time), felt that to prevent misuse of the \ndefinition in such cases, the words \u201cnot involving the carrying on of any  activity \nfor profit\u201d should be added to the definition. ASG relied on Lok Shikshana Trust  \n(supra) which highlighted that this statement shed light on the new provision.  \n31. It was submitted that Indian Chamber of Commerce (supra) recognized this \nlegislative history, and also held that the interpretation of the provision had to be \nin tune with  the advancement of the object of the changed law. The court also \nwas conscious that there were borderline cases which posed difficulty in deciding \nex facie  whether the undertaking yielding profit is a \u201cdeceptive\u201d  device or a \nbonafide  venture resulting \u201cin nominal surplus although substantially intended \nonly to advance the charitable object\u201d .

Yet, \nunder the garb of charitable purposes, orga nisations masking profit, sprang up. \nThe mask was charitable, but the \u201cheart was hunger for tax free profit\u201d .

Having regard to the nature of Section 13(1)(bb), which existed for the  \nrelevant period, the court held that the income which the trust derived was through \na business and it only fed the charity. In this light, the court rejected the trust\u2019s \ncontention with respect to the entitlement to claim tax benefit for the first part. \nCounsel pointedly referred to the observations in paragraph 24 of the said \ndecision and submitted that the court noticed the difference in language brought \nabout by the substitution of Section 11(4A) (w.e.f. 01.04.1992). The new \nprovisions enabled the Trust  to carry on business for it was incidental to the \nattainment of its activities.  \n42.

Therefore, if an organisation \nis created and carries on its activities with a view to earn profit as was held in \nBajaj Electricals , Khoday  Distilleries , and Raipur Manufacturing  (supra), it is \nprecluded from claiming to be a charitable organisation.

Mr. Ajay Vohra, urged that AEPC  has been claiming exemption under \nSection 11  from AY 1979 -80 to 1990 -91. During AY 1991 -92, the Assessing \nOfficer (\u201cAO\u201d) denied the exemption on the ground that it was carrying on \nbusiness. That order was eventually set aside by the ITAT which, held that it was \nentitled to exemption under Section 11  of the Act. Su bsequently, an amendment \nwas brought to Section 11(4A)  and AEPC had to maintain separate books of \naccounts. In AY 1992 -93, the AO again denied exemption. On appeal, the issue \nwas decided in favour of AEPC by the ITAT. The Delhi High Court upheld the \norder of the ITAT in a judgment80. AEPC received entrance fee and membership \nfee which, it claimed were exempt on the principle of mutuality. This issue too \nwas resolved in its favour from the AY 1992 -93 to AY 1997 -98 by the \njurisdictional High Court. From the a ssessment year 1998 -99 to the assessment \nyear 2008 -09, the AO accepted the assessee\u2019s claim that income was exempt \nunder Section 11  of the Act.  \n69. During AY 2009 -10 and 2010 -11, the AO denied exemption under Section \n11 on the ground that the newly inserted proviso to Section 2(15) was attracted; \nand thus the assessee was ineligible for exemption under Section 11. The AO held \nthat the assessee was ren dering services in relation to trade, commerce business \nfor consideration and the receipt of which exceeds \u20b910 lakhs. The CIT(A) allowed \nthe assessee\u2019s appeal following the decision of the High Court in its case, and \nthere being no changes in the facts and  circumstances of the case. The ITAT \nupheld the findings of the first appellate authority as it observed that the assessee \ndid not carry any activity with an object of profit, and thus the question of \nattracting the proviso did not arise.   \n \n80 Reported at 244 ITR 736", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2034, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2018f2ad-c892-4af9-81d7-19574520cce8": {"__data__": {"id_": "2018f2ad-c892-4af9-81d7-19574520cce8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\NIPL2093\\work\\long_doc_summarization\\data\\37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1022428, "creation_date": "2024-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c1659925-e99c-4986-a283-04fde7b3c0bd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\NIPL2093\\work\\long_doc_summarization\\data\\37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1022428, "creation_date": "2024-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-20"}, "hash": "195dcba94aacc096faa3b484a1013f32a82c3702475ad6a1d49a83481ffe35de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "70.

While explaining the charitable characteristic of the society \nthe counsel pointed out that the society was duly registered and its Memorandum \nof Association clearly inter -alia stated that the object for which it was established \nwas to see that the cultivators adopt all scientific methods for production of \nquality seeds in accordance with the Seeds Act and to carry on educational \nprograms designed to promote the use of certified  seeds. Charges are collected \nfrom the traders or the societies engaged in the trade of seeds. The society \nprovides quality seeds to the farmers and hence traders are prevented from selling \ninferior variety of seeds. Highlighting the activities of the auth ority, it was urged \nthat farmers are benefited by various services it offers - inspection of fields at the \ntime of seed production, supervision while processing seeds and issuing a \nvalidation certificate at the time of packing, sampling, and seed testing. The \nsociety (which is not involved in trade, commerce or business) is therefore \nrendering service to the general public as they are encouraging farmers to \npurchase quality seeds and help prevent loss to them, and loss of natural \nresources.

Mr. Harish Salve, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of Saurashtra \nCricket Association drew attention of this court towards the ambit of Section 4(3) \nof Income Tax Act, 1922 (i.e., the old Act), as compared to Section 2(15)  of the  \nIT Act, 1961 which define s \u2018charitable purpose\u2019. He also presented the \nconstruction of Section 11 in light of Thanthi  Trust (supra) . It was emphasized \nthat the objects of a trust are decisive and every surplus cannot be construed as \nprofit, as is discusse d in Krishna Warri ar (supra). Profits from trade or business \narising out of property held under trust for charitable purpose, if ploughed back \nto the extent of 100% cannot be termed as a commercial activity. This was the \nprincipal idea in omitting Section1 3(1)(bb) as it was considered as restrictive for \ncarrying out such activities. It was argued that, substitution of the definition of \n\u201ccharitable purpose\u201d in Section 2(15) by the Finance Act, 2008 has not changed \nthe law. The words \u201c in relation to any trade , commerce or business \u201d and \u201c for a \ncess, fee or consideration \u201d in the proviso to Section 2(15) implies that \nadvancement of object of  a trust may not involve activities of profit. It was urged \nthat the amendment appears to have undermined this court\u2019s deci sion in Surat Art \nSilk (supra).  \n73.  It was argued that the crucial part of the definition of \u201ccharitable purpose\u201d \nis the word \u201ccess\u201d employed in the proviso. As an explanatory measure, the \nactivities of promotional councils were taken into consideration - for example \nSurat Art Silk  supported silk manufacturers. If such activity is for a cess or a fee, \nthe organization ceases to be charitable. Activities  in the nature  of trade,  \ncommerce  or business  are not charitable  if they are for a fee or other  \nconsider ation.

It was also argued that the sport of cricket is a form of education and if it \nis not considered as a field of education, it is still an object of general public \nutility. The primary regulating body i.e., the BCCI, promotes sport in the entire \ncountry and worldwide, and the assessees herein are its second and third tier \nassociations.  The revenue generated by BCCI flows to state and regional cricket \nassociations in the form of grants to maintain stadia, conduct matches, organize \ntraining camps, and other ancillary purposes. Counsel relied on the objects \nof Saurashtra Cricket Association which inter alia include, the control, \nsupervision, regulation, encouragement, promotion and development of the game \nof cricket in the Association\u2019s jurisdiction.  Other objects include creation, \nfostering friendly relationships through sports tournaments and the creation of a \nhealthy sportsmanship spirit, through the medium of sports in general and cricket \nin particular. All other objects were similar, including \u201cto arrange, and/or \nmanage among other things league and/or any other tournaments\u201d ; organize \nmatches, lay out grounds for playing cricket, organization of matches in aid of \npublic charities, etc. If these associations sell tickets and generate revenue \nthrough  other activities, those do not necessarily mean that their objects are \ncommerc ial or to promote trade. Selling tickets for a sport  performance or match  \nis to promote cricket, and not trade . Mr. Salve also urged that the expression \n\u201ctrade\u201d has a particular  meaning; he referred to State of Gujarat v.

Therefore, separate books of accounts are not \nrequired to be maintained in terms of Sec tion 11(4A) read with the fifth and \nseventh proviso to Section 10(23C) of IT Act, 1961.

It was argued that the demand against ICAI is from 2004 -05 and the fees \ncollected from students have already been spent on various infrastructure \ndevelopment and other capital expenditur e items. The surplus amounts remaining \nwere invested in government securities/FDs of nationalized banks, so the \ndemands raised will seriously prejudice the assessees.  \n86. On behalf of the Tribune Trust, Mr. Datar  argued that the charitable nature \nof the trust can be traced back to the In Re: Trustees of the Tribune  (supra) \njudgment rendered by the Privy Council, which allowed the trust\u2019s appeal against \nthe judgment of Lahore High Court (that rejected exemption for  the trust\u2019s \nincome for AY 1932 -33). The Privy Council considered the objects of the trust \nand held it was not founded for private profit and prima facie  the trust\u2019s object \nwas of general public utility, since by supplying newspapers in the province the \ntrust involved the dissemination of educated public opinion. It was urged that the \nimpugned judgment passed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court99 in Tribune\u2019s \ncase dismissing the Tribune\u2019s appeal, erroneously relied on para 17 of Surat Art \nSilk decision (su pra) which wrongly quoted the Privy council judgment in the \nTribune\u2019s case.   \n87. It was further argued that collecting advertisements for consideration \ncannot be treated as business activity undertaken by profit because the sale price \nof the newspaper is \u20b92 whereas the cost of printing each newspaper is \u20b912 and \nthe deficits can be made up only through advertisements.

It was submitted that classification made in the ITPO \njudgment i.e., institutions driven by profit motive vis-\u00e0-vis institutions driven by \nmotive to advance objective of GPU, was correct and is in tune with the decision \nof this court in NDMC  (supra). It was urged that Article 289(1) will not apply to \nITPO as its income and property cannot be regarded as income and property of a \nState. It was also submitted that proviso to Section 2(15) applies only to the last \nlimb i.e., \u201cadvancement of object of general public utility\u201d  and not to the \npreceding limb \u201ceducation\u201d  and in respect of charity there is no discernible \ndifference between the two. Since there is no intelligible differentia and rational \nnexus in this regard, this discrimination offends Article 14.  \n89. It was argued  that the term \u201cfor a cess or fee or any other consideration\u201d  \nused in Section 2(15) is clearly violative of Article 14 as it fails to make a \ndistinction between activities that are carried out by the State or by the \ninstrumentalities or agencies of the State, and those carried out by commercial \nentities for which a consideration is charged.

Analysis and reasoning  \n92. The history of the statute and the evolving interpretation of \u201ccharitable \npurpose \u201d reveals that in - P. Krishna Warriar  (supra) , this court extensively \nconsidered the previous jurisprudence on the subject  (in light of the pre -existing \nSection 4(3) of the old law ), as well as the amendment introduced in 1953 . At \nthat time,  income  of a charitable organization,  earned from business  was subject \nto limitations. The limitations were that (i) the business was to be carried on in \nthe course of the actual carrying out of a primary purpose of the trust or \ninstitution ; or (ii) the work in connection with the business was to be mainly \ncarried on by beneficiaries of the institution.  These expressions were considered \nin Krishna Warri ar (supra) , where the court held that the term \u201cproperty\u201d (of a \ntrust) was of widest amplitude, which included business. The following decision, \nin Andhra Chamber  of Commerce  (supra) where the chamber of commerce had \namong its objects, one enabling it to advocate policies or legislation, or op pose \nthem, in addition to the object of promoting business, held that the incidental \ninclusion of such objects, involving  espousing a political purpose, did not \nundermine its essential or main purpose, of advancing objects of general public \nutility.  The new provision, i.e. , Section 2(15) of the IT Act, defined \u201ccharitable \npurpose\u201d restrictively : to deny tax exemption to activities for profit  which were \ncarried on by a trust for the advancement of an object of general public utility.  \nThe reason for this change (discussed previously) was that the advantage of tax \nexemption was not intended  to charitable trusts that were commercial concerns, \nwhich while ostensibly serving a public purpose, were fully paid for the benefits \nprovided by them.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2070, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "744e599a-5bbf-49f1-b196-e6615c56a204": {"__data__": {"id_": "744e599a-5bbf-49f1-b196-e6615c56a204", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\NIPL2093\\work\\long_doc_summarization\\data\\37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1022428, "creation_date": "2024-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f06b2720-0b1b-47d6-92c1-d7b2f6ab4e21", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\NIPL2093\\work\\long_doc_summarization\\data\\37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1022428, "creation_date": "2024-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-20"}, "hash": "2ae41c6d9c304747a183382c6a0610ff94b7471a1f3be7b71c9763d2a34f3bc7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "93. The first two decisions of some note  are Lok Shikshana Trust  and Indian \nChamber of Commerce  (supra) .

The court went on to indicate the following test:  \n\u201c21. The true test is to ask for answers to t he following questions: (a) Is the \nobject of the assessee one of general public utility? (b) Does the advancement \nof the object involve activities bringing in moneys? (c) If so, are such \nactivities undertaken (i) for profit or (ii) without profit? Even if (a) and (b) \nare answered affirmatively, if (c)(i) is answered affirmatively, the claim for \nexemption collapses.

While it  \nconsidered the previous decisions of the court , it consciously departed from them, \nand even overruled the interpretation in Indian Chamber of Commerce (supra). \nThe larger Bench in Surat Art  Silk agreed with the previous decisions to the effect \nthat the motivation for the activity in question ( i.e., for it to be charitable) should \nnot be deriving of profits. However,  the larger Bench enunciated the principle of \n\u2018predominant object\u2019 and held that what was of importance was \u201c whether the \npredominant object of the activity involved in carrying out the object  of general \npublic utility is to subserve the charitable purpose or to earn profit\u201d and that such \nan entity would not lose its charitable character merely because some profit arose \nfrom the said activity.  \n96. Thus,  was born the \u2018predominant object \u2019 test, of an organization, to \ndetermine whether it was essentially charitable, or \u2018for profit \u2019. If the predominant \nobject was not for profit,  but advancement of general public utility, that some \nprofits were earned, would not debar it from claiming to be a n organization with \na charitable purpose.

Crucially, the court emphasized that the manner of \ncarrying on of the activity in question,  was determinative:  \n\u201cthe nature of the charitable purpose, the manner in which the activity for \nadvancing the charitable purpose is being carried on and the surrounding \ncircumstances may clearly indicate that the activity is not propelled by a \ndominant profit motive.\u201d  \n97.

This lent \na fair degree of interpretive flexibility, to the courts, to decide whether a \ncommercial or business element, could be interwoven with a charitable object. \nThe amendment of 1953 ensured that income \u201capplied or accumulated for \napplication to such .. charitable purposes as relate to anything done within the \ntaxable territories, and in the case of property so held in part only for such \npurposes, the income applied or finally set apar t for application \u2026\u201d102 could not \nbe included  as taxable income of any charitable organization. This provision is a \nprecursor for Section 11 under the IT Act.  In other words, the structure of the old \nAct did not prohibit the carrying on of business; it spelt out a condition that any \nincome derived from business \u201ccarried on in the course of the actual carrying \nout of a primary purpose of the institution\u201d if applied for charitable purposes , \nwas exempt.  \n102. The second aspect is that  Surat Art Silk  (supra) , was rendered in the context \nof Section 2(15) of the IT Act, as it stood originally. However, by the Taxation \nLaws Amendment Act, 1975 (w.e.f. 01 .04.1977), Section 13(1)(bb) was inserted. \n \n102 Section 4(3)(i) of the old IT Act.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2273, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a23478f1-216b-49ce-aadd-3f15f63eed19": {"__data__": {"id_": "a23478f1-216b-49ce-aadd-3f15f63eed19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\NIPL2093\\work\\long_doc_summarization\\data\\37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1022428, "creation_date": "2024-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e3014cf-bf01-4e5e-a73b-17221187163b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\NIPL2093\\work\\long_doc_summarization\\data\\37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1022428, "creation_date": "2024-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-20"}, "hash": "cc6ad09f2acf8d0d71e2d55a2ddc71c31c5cd18390072103a2e39bb82f4797bb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "That provision excluded the operation of Sections 11 and 12 (under which income \nof charities were entitled to be exempted)  in the case of income derived from \nbusiness  by charities engaged in medical relief, education and relief to the poor, \nunless  the business fulfilled a condition:  \n\u201c(bb) in the cases of a charitable trust or institution for the relief of the \npoor, education or medical relief, which carries on any business, any \nincome derived from such business, unless the business is carried on in  the \ncourse of the actual carrying out of a primary purpose of the trust or \ninstitution;\"   \n \n103.

The court, therefore would have to resort to the \nsurrounding circumstances that led to the amendment.  \n108. The words of a statute are to be construed in their terms, according to the \ncircumstances in which they occur. A t the same time, there is some aut hority for \nthe proposition that statutes \u2013 particularly amending provisions, may be \nconsidered in the light of the previous history of the legislation. Justice Cardozo  \nin Duparquet Co. v. Evans105 said that  in questions relating to construction,  \n\"history is a teacher that is not to be ignored \u201d. In a similar vein, Chief Judge \nLearned Hand said that \u201cstatutes always have some purpose or object to \naccomplish, whose sympathetic and imaginative discovery is the surest guide to \ntheir meaning \u201d106. \n109.

It has been noticed that a number \nof entities operating  on commercial lines are claiming exemption on their \nincome either under sub -section  (23C) of section 10 or section 11 of the Act \non the ground that they are charitable  institutions. This is based on the \nargument that they are engaged in the \"advancement  of an object of general \npublic utility\" as is included in the fourth  limb of the current  definition of \n\"charitable purpose\". Such a claim, when made in respect of an activity  \ncarried out on commercial lines, is contrary to the intention of the provision.  \n5.2 With a view to limiting the scope of the phrase \u201cadvancement of any \nother  object of general public utility\", sub -section (15) of section 2 has been \namended to  provide that the advancement of any other object of general \npublic utility shall not be  a charitable purpose, if it involves the carrying on \nof any activity in the nature of  trade, commerce or business, or any activity \nof rendering any service in relation to  any trade, commerce or business, for \na cess or fee or any other consideration,  irrespective of the nature of use or \napplication, or retention,  of the income from such  activity.

Senior counsel  appearing  for the assesse es relied on Section 119 of the IT \nAct as well as decisions of this court, reported as Navnit Lal  Jhaveri (supra) and \nUCO Bank Calcutta (supra) and argued  that departmental circulars are binding \nupon tax administrators, and should be legitimately considered as aids of \nconstruction. This was in support of their reliance on the circulars in the present \ncase (No.11/2008 and No. 1/2009).  \n116. This court in Navn it Lal Jhaveri  (supra) considered Sections 2(6A)(e) and \n12(1B) of the IT Act  which were introduced by the Finance Act, 15 , 1955 (w.e.f. \n01.04.1955).  As a result of these amendments, the combined effect of the two \nprovisions was that three kinds of payments  made to shareholders companies to \nwhich those applied, were treated as taxable dividend to the extent of the \naccumulated profits held by the company. The provision was challenged. It was  \nnoticed that while introducing the amendment, the Finance Minister assured that \noutstanding loans and advances \u2013 otherwise liable to taxation as dividends in AY \n1955 -56, would not be subjected to tax if it were shown that they had been \ngenuinely refunded to the respective companies before 30 .06.1955. The \ngovernment felt that unless such a step was taken, the operation of Section 12(1B) \nwould lead to extreme hardship, as it would cover the aggregate of all outstanding \nloans of past years and could have led to unreasonably high liability on \nshareholders to whom the loans might have been advanced. A circular [No. \n20(XXI -6) /55] was issued by the Central Board of Revenue on 10.05.1955 . The \ncourt, in that context, observed that:  \n\u201cIt is clear that a circular of t he kind which was issued by the Board would \nbe binding on all officers and persons employed in the execution of the Act \nunder s. 5(8) of the Act. This circular pointed out to all the officers that it \nwas likely that some of the companies might have advance d loans to their \nshareholders as a result of genuine transactions of loans, and the idea was \nnot to the effect such transactions and not to bring them within the mischief \nof the new provision.  \nThe officers were, therefore, asked to intimate to all the companies that if the \nloans were repaid before the 30th June, 1955, in a genuine manner, they would \nnot be taken into account in determining the tax liability of the shareholders \nto whom they may have been advanced. In other words, past transactions \nwhich would normally have attracted the stringent provisions of s. 12(1B) as", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2554, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ec1b774-794f-4881-bbb7-dffd9b770266": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ec1b774-794f-4881-bbb7-dffd9b770266", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\NIPL2093\\work\\long_doc_summarization\\data\\37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1022428, "creation_date": "2024-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2de4d470-ccfc-4c61-addb-fea16e7ccb02", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\NIPL2093\\work\\long_doc_summarization\\data\\37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1022428, "creation_date": "2024-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-20"}, "hash": "503163fdaa9758773f3165bd5799549b6c82c44f7a9e3653e63fab4928bb3342", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "it was introduced in 1955, were substantially granted exemption from the \noperation of the said provisions by making it clear to all the companies and \ntheir shareholders that if the past  loans were genuinely refunded to the \ncompanies, they would not be taken into account under s. 12(1B).

This court ultimately upheld the amendments. As is evident, the judgment \nnoticed that the circular sought to soften the rigors of the otherwise harsh \nconsequence of immediate application of the amendment. There was nothing in \nthe circular to make it applic able for all times to come. It was more in the nature \nof the government issuing a temporary suspension of operation of the substantive \nprovision, introduced by the amendment.  \n118.

The court inter alia, held that  under Section \nand efficient management of assessment and collection of revenue to issue \ngeneral or special orders in respect of any class of incomes or class of cases \nsetting forth directions or instructions,  not being prejudicial to assessees, as the \nguidelines, principles or procedures to be followed in the work relating to \nassessment.

Under \nSection 119(2)(a), however, the circulars as c ontemplated therein cannot be \nadverse to the assessee.

The view expressed in Navnit Lal Jhaveri  (supra) , and later elaborated in \nUCO Bank (supra) appears to have found resonance in other decisions111 of this \ncourt. A recent  instance where this court took aid of explanatory circulars is in \nCIT v. Vatika Township112 when after holding that the amendment in question \napplied prospectively, the court also supported that holding by citing the \nrevenue\u2019s understanding about such prospective application, in a circular. What \nis of note in that judgment, is that the question o f whether circulars or explanatory \nnotes issued by the executive are binding aids of construction was not discussed; \nmore importantly, the court first interpreted the statute, in its own terms, and then \ncited the circular.  \n120. That circulars are per se not binding upon courts, in regard to interpretation \nof a statutory provision and, at best are guides or aid to interpretation for \ndepartmental authorities, who are bound to take them into account, was pithily \nstated in Keshavji Ravji & Co. and Ors. v. Comm issioner of Income Tax113 where \nthe court observed as follows:  \n\u201cThis contention and the proposition on which it rests, namely, that all \ncirculars issued by the Board have a binding legal quality incurs, quite \nobviously, the criticism of being too broadly stated. The Board cannot \npreempt a judicial interpretation of th e scope and ambit of a provision of the \n'Act' by issuing circulars on the subject. This is too obvious a proposition to \nrequire any argument for it. A circular cannot even impose on the tax payer \na burden higher than what the Act itself on a true interpret ation envisages. \nThe task of interpretation of the laws is the exclusive domain of the courts. \nHowever, this is what Sri Ramachandran really has in mind - circulars \nbeneficial to the assessees and which tone down the rigour of the law issued \nin exercise of  the statutory power under Section 119 of the Act or under \ncorresponding provisions of the predecessor Act are binding on the \nauthorities in the administration of the Act. The Tribunal, much less the High \nCourt, is an authority under the Act. The circulars  do not bind them. But the \nbenefits of such circulars to the assessees have been held to be permissible \neven though the circulars might have departed from the strict tenor of the \nstatutory provision and mitigated the rigour of the law. But that is not the \nsame thing as saying that such circulars would either have a binding effect in \nthe interpretation of the provision itself or that the Tribunal and the High \nCourt are supposed to interpret the law in the light of the circular.

However, if they are contrary to the \nplain words of a statute, they are not binding. Furthermore, they cannot bind the \ncourts, which have to independently interpret the statute, in  their own terms. At \nbest, in such a task, they may be considered as departmental understanding on the \nsubject and have limited persuasive value. At the highest, they are binding on tax \nadministrators and authorities, if they accord with and are not at odd s with the \nstatute; at the worst, if they cut down the plain meaning of a statute, or fly on the \nface of their express terms, they are to be ignored.  \n \nB.

It was held that in view of such a qualification, the Court \nhas not only to look at the words but also to look at the context, collocation , and \nthe object of such words in respect of such matters and fact or the meaning to be \nconveyed by the use of the words under the circumstances. Almost the same \nreasoning has been echoed in N.K. Jain and Ors. v. C.K. Shah and Ors119.  \n125. The importance of terms expressly defined in a statute is that they are \ninternal an d binding  aids to interpretation. The prefacing \u2013 to any definition \u2013 of \nthe phrase \u201c unless the context otherwise requires \u201d merely signifies that in case \nthere is anything expressly to the contrary, in any specific provision (s) in the body \nof the Act, a different meaning can be attributed.

Parliamentary endeavour, was to alter the regime applicable to taxation of \nGPU category charities, under the IT Act. The absolute bar imposed on GPU \ncharit ies from carrying on activities in the nature of trade, commerce or business, \nor of rendering any service in relation to any trade, commerce or business, for a \ncess or fee or any other consideration , evidences this intent. The o riginal Section \n2(15) did no t allude to trade, commerce or business , or any service in relation to \nsuch activities. It only enjoined the GPU charities from involving themselves \nfrom carrying on of any activity for profit127 (which was interpreted in Surat Art \nSilk).  This substantial change brought about by the amendments of 2008 -2012 \nand 2015 is the  prohibition from engaging in any kind of  activity in the nature  of \nbusiness, commerce, or trade or any rendering any service in relation thereto , and \nearning income by  the way of cess, fee or consideration.  In the opinion of this \ncourt, the express deletion of the reference to \u2018activity for profit\u2019 on the one hand, \nand the enactment of an expanded list of what cannot be done by GPU charities \nif they are to retain their characteristic as charities, is an emphatic manner in \nwhich Parliament wished to express itself.  \n139.

Clause (2) of Article 289 also similarl y does not define or specify \u2014 \nnor does it require that the law made thereunder should so define or specify. \nIt cannot be said that unless the law made under and with reference to clause \n(2) specifies the particular trading or business operations to be tax ed, it \nwould not be a law within the meaning of clause (2). Coming back to the \nlanguage of clause (2), a question is raised, why does the proviso speak of \ntaxation  in respect of trade or business  when the main limb of sub -section \n(1) speaks only of taxes i n respect of lands or buildings and income? Is the \nambit of proviso wider than the main limb? Is it an independent provision of \na substantive nature notwithstanding the label given to it as a proviso? Or is \nit only an exception? It is asked. We are, howeve r, of the considered opinion \nthat it is more important to give effect to the language of and the intention \nunderlying the proviso than to find a label for it. It is clarificatory in nature \nwithout a doubt; it appears to be more indeed. It is concerned main ly with \nthe \u201cincome\u201d (of Provincial Governments) referred to in the main limb of \nsub-section (1). It speaks of tax on the \u201clands or buildings\u201d in that context \nalone, as we shall explain in the next paragraph. The idea underlying the \nproviso is to make it c lear that the exemption of income of Provincial \nGovernment operates only where the income is earned or received by it as a \nGovernment; it will not avail where the income is earned or received by the \nProvincial Government on account of or from any trade or business carried \non by it \u2014 that is  a trade or a business carried on with profit motive. In the \nlight of the language of the proviso to Section 155 and clause (2) of Article \n289, it is not possible to say that every activity carried on by the Government \nis governmental activity. A distinction has to be made between governmental \nactivity  and trade and business carried on by the Government, at least for \nthe purposes of this clause. It is for this reason, we say, that unless an activity \nin the nature of trade and business is carried on with a profit motive, it would \nnot be a trade or business contemplated by clause (2). For example, mere \nsale of government properties, immovable or moveable, or granting of leases \nand licences in respect of its properties does no t amount to carrying on trade \nor business. Only where a  trade or business  is carried on with a profit motive \n\u2014 or any property is used or occupied for the purpose of carrying on such \ntrade or business \u2014 that the proviso [or for that matter clause (2) of Ar ticle \n289] would be attracted. Where there is no profit motive involved  in any \nactivity  carried on by the State Government, it cannot be said to be carrying \non a trade or business within the meaning of the proviso/clause (2), merely \nbecause some profit res ults from the activity [ For example, almost every \nState Government maintains one or more guest houses in Delhi for \naccommodating their officials and others connected with the affairs of the \nState. But, when some rooms/accommodation are not occupied by suc h \npersons and remain vacant, outsiders are accommodated therein, though at \nhigher rates. This activity cannot obviously be called carrying on trade or \nbusiness nor can it be said that the building is used or occupied for the \npurpose of any trade or busines s carried on by the State Government.] .

If fee or cess or such consideration is \ncollected for the purpose of an activity, by a state department or entity, which is \nset up by statute, its mandate to collect such amounts cannot be  treated as \nconsideration  towards trade or business.

Likewise, statutory boards \nand authorities, who are under mandate to develop housing, industrial and other \nestates, including development of res idential housing at reasonable or subsidized \ncosts, which might entail charging higher amounts from some section of the \nbeneficiaries, to cross -subsidize the main activity, cannot be characterized as \nengaging in business.

The word \"cess\" is used in Ireland and is still in use in India although the \nword rate has replaced it in England. It means a ta x and is generally used \nwhen the levy is for some special administrative expense which the name \n(health cess, education cess, road cess etc.) indicates. When levied as an \nincrement to an existing tax, the name matters not for the validity of the cess \nmust be judged of in the same way as the validity of the tax to which it is an \nincrement. By Schedule A(1) read with Section 3 of the Act, it is collected as \nan additional levy with a tax, which, as described in Schedule A, is \nundoubtedly one within the powers of the State Legislature and has been so \neven prior to the Constitution....\u201d  \n146. The seven -judge bench judgment of this court in  India Cement Ltd. & Ors. \nv. State of Tamil Nadu and Ors .132, approved the definition propounded by \nHidayatulla, J. In  Vijayalas hmi Rice Mill and Ors. v. Commercial Tax Officers, \nPalakol & Ors133 this court observed that  \n\u201c13. Hence ordinarily a cess is also a tax, but is a special kind of tax. \nGenerally tax raises revenue which can be used generally for any purpose by \nthe State. For  instance, the income tax or excise tax or sales tax are taxes \nwhich generate revenue which can be utilised by the Union or the State \nGovernments for any purpose e.g. for payment of salary to the members of the \narmed forces or civil servants, police, etc. or for development programmes, \netc. However, cess is a tax which generates revenue which is utilised for a \nspecific purpose. For instance, health cess raises revenue which is utilised for \nhealth purposes e.g. building hospitals, giving medicines to the poo r, etc. \nSimilarly, education cess raises revenue which is used for building schools or \nother educational purposes.\u201d  \n147. The expression \"cess\" , therefore, implies a tax or impost levied for some \nspecial purpose, which may be levied as an increment to an ex isting tax.

In Salmond on Jurisprudence, the word 'consideration' has been \nexplained in the following words.  \nA consideration in its widest sense is the reason, motive or inducement, by \nwhich a man is moved to bind himself by an agreement. It is for nothing \nthat he consents to impose an obligation upon himself, or to abandon or \ntransfer a right. It is in consideration of such and such a fact that he agrees \nto bear new burdens or to forego the benefits which the law already allows \nhim. \n57. The gist of the term 'con sideration' and its legal significance has been \nclearly summed up in Section 2(d) of the Indian Contract Act which \ndefines 'consideration' thus:  \n\u2018When, at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has \ndone or abstained from doing, or doe s or abstains from doing, or promises \nto do or to abstain from doing, something, such act or abstinence or \npromise is called a consideration to the promise.\u2019  \n58. From a conspectus of decisions and dictionary meaning, the \ninescapable conclusion that follows is that 'consideration' means a \nreasonable equivalent or other valuable benefit passed on by the promisor \nto the promisee or by the transferor to the transfe ree. Similarly, when the \nword 'consideration' is qualified by the word 'sole', it makes consideration \nstronger so as to make it sufficient and valuable having regard to the facts, \ncircumstances and necessities of the case.\u201d  \n150. Therefore, what Parliament intended \u2013 through the amendments in question \nwas to proscribe, involvement or engagement of GPU charities, from any form \n(\u201cin the nature of \u201d) of activities that were trade, business or commerce, or engage \nor involve in providing services in relation to trade, business or commerce - for a \nfee, cess or other consideration. The inclusion of the term \u201c in the nature of \u201d was \nby design, to clarify beyond doubt, that not only business, trade or commerce, but \nall activities in the nature of, or resembling  them, were  proscribed.

Therefore, to summarise on the legal position on this - if a property is held \nunder trust, and such property is a business, the case would fall under Section \n11(4) and not under Section 11(4A) of the Act. Section 11(4A) of the Act, would \napply only to a case where the business is not held under trust. There is a \ndifference between a property or business held under trust and a business carried \non by or on behalf of the trust. This distinction was recognized in Surat Art Silk  \n(supra) , which observed that if a business undertaking is held under trust for a \ncharitable purpose, the income from it would be entitled to exemption under \nSection 11(1) of the Act.  \n161. The interface between Sections 11(1) and (4) is of some importance. \nFirstly , under Section 11(4), it is only the business which is held under the trust \nthat would enjoy exemption in respect of its income under Section 11(1). \nSecondly , there is a distinctio n between the objects of a trust and the powers given \nto the trustees to effectuate the purposes of the trust. In this regard, the \nobservations of this court, in J.K. Trust (supra) assume relevance. There, one of \nthe questions which arose was whether the o ffice of managing agency , which was \nan office of profit , was in fact settled upon trust and, therefore, could be \nconsidered to be business held under trust. The court held that for the purposes of \nSection 4(3)(i) of the 1922 Act, the office of managing age ncy was property \nwhich could be held under trust. The revenue pointed out that on the terms of the \ntrust deed previously executed by the settlors (on 15.06.1945 ), the properties \nwhich the trustees are to hold and stand possessed of , were only the sum of \n\u20b91,00,000/ -, any donations and contribution received by the trustees and all \naccretions thereto , and investment in securities made from time to time \nrepresenting the accretions .

What then is the interpre tation of the expression \u201cincidental\u201d profits, from \n\u201cbusiness\u201d being \u201cincidental to the attainment of the objectives\u201d of the GPU \ncharity  (which occurs in Section 11(4A) )? As stated earlier, the  interpretation of \nthat expression in Thanthi  Trust (supra) was in the context of a per se charity, i.e. , \nwhere the trust\u2019s object was education. However, the restrictive or negative terms \nenjoining GPU charities from carrying on profitable activity had been deleted in \ndeterminative test for defining  whether a Trust was a GPU charity if its \npredominant object was to carry out a charitable purpose and that if that was the \ncase, the fact that it earned profit would not per se deprive it of  tax exemption. \nThis decision was interpreted in the context of Section 11(4A) by this court in \nThant hi Trust , to hold that business can be incidental to attainment of the trust\u2019s \nobjects.  \n167. Thus, the journey which began with Surat Art  Silk was interpreted in \nThant hi Trust to mean that the carrying on of business by GPU charity was \npermissible as long as it inured to the benefit of the trust. The change brought \nabout by the amendments in quest ions, however, place the focus on an entirely \ndifferent perspective: that if at all any activity in the nature of trade , commerce \nor business, or a service in the nature of the same,  for any form of consideration \nis permissible, that activity should be int rinsically linked to, or a part of the GPU \ncategory  charity\u2019s object. Thus, the test of the charity being driven by a \npredominant  object is no longer good law. Likewise, the ambiguity with respect \nto the kind of activities generating profit which could fee d the main object and \nincidental profit -making also is not good law.

If one keeps this in \nmind, what Section 2(15) emphasizes is that so long as a GPU\u2019s charity\u2019s object \ninvolves activities whi ch also generates profits ( incidental , or in other words, \nwhile actually  carrying  out the objectives of GPU, if some profit is generated), it \ncan be granted  exemption provided the quantitative limit  (of not exceeding 20%)  \nunder second proviso to Section 2( 15) for receipts from such profits, is adhered \nto. \n172. Yet another manner of looking at the definition together with Sections  \n10(23) and 11 is that for achieving a general public utility object, if the charity \ninvolves itself in activities, that entail ch arging amounts only at cost or marginal \nmark up over cost, and also derive some profit , the prohibition against carrying \non business or service relating to business is not attracted  - if the quantum of such \nprofits do not exceed 20% of its overall receipts . \n173. It may be useful to conclude this section on interpretation with some \nillustrations. The example of Gandhi Peace Foundation disseminating Mahatma \nGandhi\u2019s philosophy (in Surat Art Silk ) through museums and exhibitions and \npublishing his works, for n ominal cost, ipso facto is not business. Likewise, \nproviding access to low -cost hostels to weaker segments of society, where the fee \nor charges recovered cover the costs  (including administrative expenditure)  plus \nnominal mark up ; or renting marriage halls for low amounts, again with a fee \nmeant to cover costs ; or blood bank services, again with fee to cover costs, are \nnot activities in the nature of business.

These provisions, form the machinery to \ncontrol the conditions under which income is exempt. The effect of the \nseventeenth proviso to Section 10(23C) is to impose the same condition i.e. , that \nthat the trade, commerce or business activity or service relating to trade, business \nor commerce, should be part of the GPU\u2019s activities, to achieve its object of \nadvancing general public utility.  The other condition \u2013 which is drawn i n as part \nof the exemption condition, is that if such trading or commercial activity takes \nplace the receipts should be confined to a prescribed percentage of the overall \nreceipts.

In the opinion of t his court, the change intended by Parliament through the \namendment of Section 2(15) was sought to be emphasised and clarified by the \namendment of Section 10(23C) and the insertion of Section 13(8).

It would be essential now to deal with certain kinds of receipts which GPU \ncharities, typically statutory housing boards, regulatory authorities and \ncorporations may be entitled to, if mandated to collect or receive. During the \ncourse of h earing, learned counsel s highlighted that statutory boards, and \ncorporations have to recover the cost of providing essential goods and services in \npublic interest, and also fund large scale development and maintain public \nproperty. These would entail recov ering charges or fees, interest and also \nreceiving interest for holding deposits. It was further pointed out that in some \ncases, income in the form of rents \u2013 having regard to the nature of the schemes \nwhich the concerned board, trust or corporation may be  mandated or permitted to \ncarry on , has to be received. For instance, in some situations, for certain kinds of \nproperties, the boards may be permitted only to lease out their assets and receive \nrents.  \n177. The answers to these, in the opinion of this court, are that the definition \nipso facto does not spell out whether certain kinds of income can be excluded. \nHowever, the reference to specific provisions enabling or mandating collection \nof certain rates, tari ffs or costs would have to be examined.

This \ncourt had occasion to deal with the provision while it was in force in the GIDC \ncase (supra) . The court had then emphasized that the expression \u201cdevelopment\u201d \nin Section 10(20A) should be understood widely; thus, all development \nprogrammes \u201crelating to any industry\u201d fell within the purview of \u201cdevelopment\u201d. \nThe court also highlighted that nothing in the IT Act laid down how a corporation \ncould be termed as a development corporation nor was there anything mandating \nthat fee chargeable by such corporations was confined to non -industrial activities.  \n179.

This court \nrefuted the argument of the revenue that if a corporation did not fall within the \ndefinition of \u201clocal authority\u201d it could not claim to be a GPU charity. It was held \nthat Section 10(20) and Se ction 11 of the 1961 Act operate in totally different \nspheres. Even if the Board is not considered as a local authority, it is not precluded \nfrom claiming exemption under Section 11(1) of the 1961 Act.

These two \nprovisions confer different though overlapping benefits.

There is a two -fold distinction between the now -deleted Section 10(20A) \nand the newly added Section 10(46) (w.e.f. 01.06.2011) . Firstly, that the erstwhile \nSection 10(20A) applied to a limited class of undertaking i.e., the bodies, or \ncorporations, constituted by or under any law -confined to the planning and \ndevelopment of housing infrastructure.  However, the newly added Section \n10(46) is wider in comparison and the activities of any body or authority or board \nconstituted by or under any central or State Act with \u201c the object of regulating or \nadministering any activity for the benefit of the general public \u201d, has broader \nimport. In a sense, t he newly added Section 10(46), resembles a GPU category \ncharity classified under Section 2(15).  The second distinction is that Section \n10(20A) did not bar any board, or corporations , etc. from indulging in commercial \nactivities. However, sub -clause (b) of  Section 10(46) imposes such a bar, and the \nconcerned body cannot claim tax exemption if it engages in commercial activity.   \n188. The manner in which GPU charities has been dealt with under the \ndefinition clause, i.e., Section 2(15), indicates that even t hough trading or \ncommercial activity or service in relation to trade, commerce or business appears \nto be barred  \u2013 nevertheless the ban is lifted somewhat by the proviso which \nenables such activities to be carried out if they are intrinsically  part of the a ctivity \nof achieving the object of general public utility.  Furthermore, in the case of GPU \ncharities there is a quantified limit of the overall receipts, which is permissible \nfrom such commercial activity.  In the case of local authorities and corporation s \ncovered by Section 10(46) no such activities are seemingly permitted.  \n189.

In respect of revenues from sale of media rights, an arrangement has \nevolved over tim e. Until 1991 -92 the income from media rights was meager. \nWith the growth in income from media rights, it became necessary to optimize \nthe arrangement for sale of media rights. For a Test series or ODI series \nconducted in multiple centers and organised by BCCI and multiple state \nassociations, it was found that if each state association were to negotiate the \nsale of rights to events in its centre, its negotiating strength would be low. It \nwas, therefore, agreed that BCCI would negotiate the sale of media rig hts for \nthe entire country to optimize the income under this head. It was further \ndecided that out of the receipts from the sale of media rights 70% of the gross \nrevenue less production cost would belong to the state associations. Every \nyear, BCCI has paid  out exactly 70% of its receipts from media rights (less - \nproduction cost) to the state associations. This amount has been utilized by \nthe respective associations to build infrastructure and promote cricket, \nmaking the game more popular, nurturing and enco uraging cricket talent, \nand leading to higher revenues from media rights.  \n*************      ****************  \nEven in the event that exemption under section 11 is denied, the payments to \nstate associations must be allowed as a deduction, as expenditure laid  out or \nexpended wholly and exclusively for the purpose of earning such income, it \nmust be appreciated that in order to earn revenues, BCCI was and continues \nto be highly dependent on the state associations. BCCI does not have the \ninfrastructure and the re sources to conduct the matches by itself and is \ndependent on the state associations to conduct the matches. The income from \nmedia rights is dependent on the efforts of the state associations in conducting \nthe matches from which the media rights accrue. The  division of revenues and \nexpenditure is a matter of arrangement between the parties. Certain incomes \nsuch as sale of ticket revenues belong to the state associations, who meet the \nexpenditure on the matches such as security for players and spectators \ntemp orary stands, operation of floodlights, Score Boards, management of \ncrowd, insurance for the match, electricity charges, catering etc. Whereas \nwith regard to the income from sale of media rights, the arrangement between", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3607, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3201d0f-74cf-462b-a5f8-86234e2e12e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3201d0f-74cf-462b-a5f8-86234e2e12e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "126", "file_name": "37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\NIPL2093\\work\\long_doc_summarization\\data\\37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1022428, "creation_date": "2024-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "26a1a7fa-e372-4838-af31-1f72f5b8b97c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "126", "file_name": "37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\NIPL2093\\work\\long_doc_summarization\\data\\37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1022428, "creation_date": "2024-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-20"}, "hash": "e37e17c26903dd1a32c9300ee1c1d869db12a5c426549a6cc055e479482616c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "BCCI and the State Associations has been that 70% of the revenue would \nbelong to the State Associations.

The ITAT accepted the assesse e\u2019s contentions, and held that the \nassociations were GPU charities:  \n\u201c35. Let us take a pause here and examine as to what are the activities of the \nassessee cricket associations so as to be brought within the ambit of trade, \ncommerce or business. We have se en objects of the association, which are \nreproduced earlier in our order, and it is not even the case of the revenue \nthat these objects have anything to do with any trade, commerce or business; \nthese objects are simply to promote cricket. The trigger for i nvoking proviso \nto Section 2(15), as Shri Soparkar rightly contends, has to an activity of the \nassessee which is in the nature of trade, commerce or business. However, \nthe case of the revenue authorities hinges on the allegation that the way and \nmanner in which cricket matches are being organized, particularly the IPL \nmatches, the activity of organizing cricket matches is nothing but brute \ncommerce. Undoubtedly, it would appear that right from the time Kerry \nPacker started his World Series Cricket in 1977, there has been no looking \nback in commercialization of cricket and the impact of this \ncommercialization has not left Indian cricket intact. The Indian Premier \nLeague and the rules of the game being governed by the dictates of \ncommercial considerations may seem to be one such example of \ncommercialization of Indian cricket. The difficulty for the case of the revenue \nbefore us, however, is that these matches are not being organized by the local \ncricket associations. We are told that the matches are being organ ized by the \nBoard of Cricket Control of India, but then, if we are to accept this claim \nand invoke the proviso to Section 2(15) for this reason, it will amount to a \nsituation in which proviso to Section 2(15) is being invoked on account of \nactivities of an  entity other than the assessees - something which law does not \npermit. We are not really concerned, at this stage, whether the allegations \nabout commercialization of cricket by the BCCI are correct or not, because \nthat aspect of the matter would be relevan t only for the purpose of proviso \nto Section 2(15) being invoked in the hands of the BCCI. We do not wish to \ndeal with that aspect of the matter or to make any observations which would \nprejudge the case of the BCCI. Suffice to say that the very foundation of \nrevenue's case is devoid of legally sustainable basis for the short reason that \nthe commercialization of cricket by the BCCI, even if that be so, cannot be \nreason enough to invoke the proviso to Section 2(15). We are alive o learned \nCommissioner (DR)'s suggestion that the cricket associations cannot be seen \non standalone basis as the BCCI is nothing but an apex body of these cricket \nassociations at a collective level and whatever BCCI does is at the behest of \nor with the connivance of the local cricket a ssociations, and that it is not the \ncase that anyone can become a Member of the BCCI because only a", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3521, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc6e131a-22ed-4a51-abbc-6cd20957c6c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc6e131a-22ed-4a51-abbc-6cd20957c6c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\NIPL2093\\work\\long_doc_summarization\\data\\37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1022428, "creation_date": "2024-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "88cf2bc3-4f89-4a31-8bcd-cf9f0b0698fe", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_path": "D:\\NIPL2093\\work\\long_doc_summarization\\data\\37657_2017_1_1501_39247_Judgement_19-Oct-2022_149pg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1022428, "creation_date": "2024-10-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-20"}, "hash": "3464a11d3bb9c89a3a2504af176b695d0f46acd512934749a60b05375f799902", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "recognized cricket association can become a Member of the BCCI. We are \nalso alive to learned Commissioner's argument that what is being sought to \nbe protect ed by the charitable status of these associations is the share of \nthese cricket associations from the commercial profits earned by the BCCI \nby organizing the cricket matches. The problem, however, is that the \nactivities of the apex body, as we have explain ed earlier, cannot be reason \nenough to trigger proviso to Section 2(15) in these cases. Whether these \ncricket associations collectively constitute BCCI or not, in the event of BCCI \nbeing involved in commercial activities, the taxability of such commercial \nprofits will arise in the hands of the BCCI and not the end beneficiaries. Even \nin such a case the point of taxability of these profits is the BCCI and not the \ncricket associations, because, even going by learned Commissioner's \narguments, these receipts in  the hands of the cricket associations is nothing \nbut appropriation of profits. What can be taxed is accrual of profits and not \nappropriation of profits. In any event, distinction between the cricket \nassociations and the BCCI cannot be ignored for the purp oses of tax \ntreatment. There is no dispute that the matches were organized by the BCCI, \nand the assessee cannot thus be faulted for the commercial considerations \nsaid to be inherent in planning the matches.

The game of competitive cricket, at the organizational level is structured \nin such a manner that BCCI has  umbilical ties with the state associations. Not \nonly are the latter, the members who constitute BCCI and elect its governing \nbodies, they also own vital infrastructure necessary to play cricket: such as stadia, \nand all related facilities. BCCI does not own those facilities or infrastructure  and \ndepends on them . Furthermore, the state associations are the channels through \nwhich players are  mostly selected, and get opportunities to participate in state, \nnational and international level cricket.  \n228.

The management of the game of cricket is structured in such a way that \nthis link is apparent at every match or fixture of significance.

It was further decided that out of the receipts \nfrom the sale of media rights 70% of the gross revenue less production cost \nwould belong to the state associations.  Every year, BCCI has paid out \nexactly 70% of its receipts from media rights (less - production cost) to the \nstate associations.

The ITAT appears to have been swayed by the \nsubmission that the amount given by the BCCI were towards capital subsidy.  \n236.

In the light of these, the Court is of the opinion that the ITAT \u2013 as well as \nthe High Court fell into error in accepting at face value the submission that the \namou nts made over by BCCI to the cricket associations were in the nature of \ninfrastructure subsidy. In each case, and for every year, the tax authorities are \nunder an obligation to carefully examine and see the pattern of receipts and \nexpenditure. Whilst doing  so, the nature of rights conveyed by the BCCI to the \nsuccessful bidders, in other words, the content of broadcast rights as well as the \narrangement with respect to state associations (either in the form of master \ndocuments, resolutions or individual agree ments with state associations) have to \nbe examined. It goes without saying that there need not be an exact correlation or \na proportionate division between the receipt and the actual expenditure. This is in \nline with the principle that what is an adequate c onsideration for something which \nis agreed upon by parties is a matter best left to them.

The Tribune Trust was constituted pursuant to a will executed by late \nSardar Dial Singh Majithia.

Under the old Act, a question arose as to whether the activity of running a \nnewspaper was one of general public utility; the revenue disallowed the \nexemption for AY 1 932-33. This was affirmed by the Lahore High Court.
