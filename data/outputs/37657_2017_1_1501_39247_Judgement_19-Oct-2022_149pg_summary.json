Legislative history and recent legislation are also relevant.  The primary method, however, is to understand the plain language of the enactment in light of its purpose and objective.  Court precedent supports using legislative history to interpret provisions, going beyond the literal text to consider the statute's overall scheme, purpose, and potential consequences of different interpretations.

    "decision_outcome": "The court will interpret the true meaning of \"charitable purpose\" as amended in 2008, considering subsequent changes.  Statutory definitions are binding unless a specific provision contradicts them.  The court's interpretation considers the context, word placement, and the intended meaning.  GPU charities are distinct from established charity categories (education, medical relief, poverty relief, and later additions like environmental preservation and yoga), and are not restricted from profit-making activities.  This principle is supported by previous court decisions.\n",

The trust argued it wasn't intended to be profitable, with all income used for its activities and none distributed privately.  The High Court acknowledged the trust's activities as financing objects of general public utility, regardless of the scale of newspaper publication.  A key question is whether the trust's income, particularly advertisement revenue (essential for newspaper publication), constitutes trade, commerce, or business.\n"

While the court may consider circulars as aids to interpretation,  they are not binding.  The court's primary role is to interpret the law; circulars issued by the executive cannot preempt this judicial function.  Although beneficial circulars that lessen the law's strictness are permissible for administrative authorities, they do not dictate the court's interpretation of the law.  In a specific case, the court interpreted a statute independently before referencing a supporting circular.\n",

Tax authorities must annually review if an assessee's activities constitute \"trade, commerce, or business,\" considering whether charges are cost-based or significantly higher. If so, they must check if the exemption limit (as amended) in Section 2(15) has been exceeded, thus potentially disqualifying the assessee from exemption.  Numerous appeals, including those against several Improvement Trusts (Moga, Hoshiarpur, Bathinda, Fazilka, Sangrur, Patiala, Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Pathankot, Hansi) and Special Leave Petitions against Gujarat, were disposed of according to this judgment.
