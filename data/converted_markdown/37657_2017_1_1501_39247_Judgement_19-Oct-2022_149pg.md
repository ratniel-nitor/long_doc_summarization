1. Leave grante d in all matters where leave has not already been granted.  
C.A. No. 21762/2017 ( Assistant Commission of Income Tax, Exemptions v. 
Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority ) is taken as the lead matter .  
2.  Religious and charitable trusts have existed in one form or the other, tracing 
their origins to the instinct of benevolence, which is part of human nature.  Indian 
philanthropy has enriched its cultural heritage, particu larly in catering to the 
educational, medical, socio -economic, and religious needs of the people. Here its 
role has been supplementary to the efforts of the State, which has recognized the 
public utility of this impulse, and granted tax exemptions.  Indian income -tax laws 
have favoured charities, even granted preferential treatment since 1886. The law, 
while granting exemption to income from religious and charitable  trusts has taken 
effective measures to minimise misuse of trust funds. As a result, a 
charita ble trust loses tax exemption if certain provisions are not complied with, 
and if its activities  do not fall under Section 10 of the Act . Such trusts also have 
to apply their income to the charitable  objects within a specified period, maintain 
proper audited accounts, and invest or utilise funds in a manner so that no benefit 
is derived by the settlor, trustees, their relatives, or other persons.1  
3. The scope and amplitude of the definition “charitable purpose” under the 
Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereaf ter “Income Tax Act" or “the IT Act”) has engaged 
the courts’ (including that of this court) attention on myriad occasions. The 
expression “not involving the carrying on of any activity for profit”  in the last 
limb of the definition [Section 2(15) prior to  amendment by Finance Act, 1983] 
was the subject of debate in no less than five judgments of this court (including 
that of a five -member bench).  
4. In these batch of appeals and special leave petitions, the primary question 
which falls for consideration i s the correct interpretation of the proviso to Section 
 
1 Sections 11, 12, 12 -A and 13 of the Income -tax Act, 1961.  

2(15)2 of the IT Act  introduced by amendment w.e.f. 01.04.2009. It is necessary, 
at this stage, to notice that the IT Act visualized three kinds of charitable 
purposes: medical relief, education, and relief for the poor – which are described 
hereafter as “per se purposes” . To this list, Parliament has, by amendments, 
added other categories, such as preservation of environment (including 
watersheds, forests, and wildlife) and preservation of monuments or places or 
objects of artistic or historic interest, and yoga. The last – or the residual purpose 
included by the definition - is “advancement of any other object of general public 
utility”  (hereafter referred to as  “GPU category”), which is the subject of 
interpretation in the present case.  
5. The Director General of Income Tax f or exemptions, Commissioner of 
Income Tax (“CIT”) in various states, and other officials of the Income tax 
department (hereafter compendiously referred to as “the revenue”) have appealed 
the decisions of various High Courts, which have held that the carryi ng on of any 
trade, commerce , or business, is not a per se bar or disqualification for a GPU 
category charitable trust to claim to be such, precluding its tax -exempt status 
under the IT Act.  
I. Brief history of legislative changes and this court’s interpreta tion 
A. Provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1922  
6. The provisions of the erstwhile Income Tax Act, 1922 (hereafter “the old 
Act”) enabled tax exemption claims by trusts for their income from business 
activity, provided trust s were created thereon.  The Privy Council in  The Trustees 
 
2 “charitable purpose” includes relief of the poor, education, medical relief, preservation of environment 
(including watersheds, forests and wildlife) and preservation of monuments or places or objects of artistic or 
historic interest, and the advancement of any other object of general public utility:  
Provided that the advancement of any other object of general public utility shall not be a charitable 
purpose, if it involves the carrying on of any activity in the nature of trad e, commerce or business, or any activity 
of rendering any service in relation to any trade, commerce or business, for a cess or fee or any other 
consideration, irrespective of the nature of use or application, or retention, of the income from such activity :..…”  
(emphasis supplied)  

of Tribune Press, Lahore v. CIT, Punjab3 (hereafter “ In Re: Trustees of the 
Tribune ”) held that the income of the Tribune Press fell within section 4(3)(i) of 
the old Act, and it was implied that income from the press was derived from 
property held under trust to maintain a newsp aper, to keep up its liberal policy 
and to devote surplus funds to improve the newspaper. The word “property” 
occurring under section 4(3)(i) of that Act was also held4 to include a business 
too. The old Act was amended twice with the object of eliminatin g and getting 
rid of tax exemptions for trusts, which were otherwise eligible for it. The first 
amendment of 1939  inserted5 a new clause  (ia) in the then existing provision. 
This provided that income derived from business carried on by or on behalf of a 
charitable trust or religious institution could be limited to only such business 
income as was derived by the trust or institution from busines s carried on either 
in the course of the carrying on of a trust’s primary purpose,  or carried on mainly 
by the beneficiaries of the trust or institution. The Lahore High Court in 
Charitable  Gadodia Swadeshi Stores  v. CIT6, observed:  
“Viewed in its proper perspective, therefore, clause (ia) can be taken to apply 
only such business as is carried on behalf of religious or 
 
4 In Commissioner of Income Tax v. P. Krishna Warriar , (1964) 8 SCR 36 : (1964) 53 ITR 176 this court, citing 
and relying on In re, Trustees of the Tribune  [(1939) ITR 415 PC] held that:   
“This Court in  J.K. Trust, Bombay  v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Excess Profits Tax, Bombay  [(1957) 32 ITR 
535] endorsed the said view and held that “property” is a term of the widest import and that business would 
undoubtedly be property unless there was something to the contrary in the enactment. If business was property, 
it could be held under trust for religious and char itable purposes. As the business of running the Arya Vaidya 
Sala vested under trust for religious and charitable purposes, it would fall under clause (i), if the other conditions 
laid down therein were satisfied.”   
5 Section 4(3) of the Indian Income -tax (Amendment) Act, 1939, reads as follows:  
“(3) Any income, profits or gains falling within the following classes shall not be included in the total income of 
the person receiving them:]  
(i) Subject to the provisions of clause (c) of sub -section (1) of section 16, any income derived from property held 
under trust or other legal obligation wholly for religious or charitable purposes, in so far as such income is 
applied or accumulated for application to such religious or charitable purposes as relate to an ything done 
within the taxable territories, and in the case of property so held in part only for such purposes, the income 
applied or finally set apart for application thereto:  
(ia) Any income derived from business carried on on behalf of a religious or ch aritable institution when the income 
is applied solely to the purposes of the institution and - 
(a) the business is carried on in the course of the carrying out of a primary purpose of the institution, or  
(b) the work in connection with the business is mainly carried on by beneficiaries of the institution”

charitable  institutions which were not held under trust and not to such 
business as was itself held under trust or was conducted by or on b ehalf of 
such charitable  or religious institutions as were held under trust. If it was 
intended to narrow down the scope of clause (1) so as to withdraw the 
exemption enjoyed by a business held under trust or conducted by or on behalf 
of a religious or  charitable  trust, the new clause should have been added as 
proviso to the old clause.”  
 7. The Act was again amended by the Finance Act, 19537 wherein 
clause  (ia) was deleted from section 4(3)(i) of the old Act and instead inserted as 
its proviso. Parliamentary intent, in transforming old clause  (ia) into a proviso to 
Section 4 (3)(i) was that whenever business was carried on behalf of a religious 
or charitable  institution, the conditions prescribed in clause  (b) of proviso to 
clause (i) had to be s atisfied in addition to the general condition of exemption set 
out in the substantive part of clause (i). Parliament’s attempt to exempt income 
from business activity upon complying with other conditions - apart from those 
laid down in clause (i) - was int erpreted by this court in CIT v. P. Krishna Warriar8 
(hereafter “ Krishna Warriar ”). The court observed that:  
“The legal position may briefly be stated thus: Clause (i) of section 4(3) of 
the Act takes in every property or a fractional part of it held in t rust wholly 
for religious or charitable  purposes. It also takes in such property held only 
 
7 Section 4 of Finance Act, 1953 added proviso to Section 4(3)(i); it reads as follows:  
“Provided that such income shall be included in the total income — 
[(a) if it is applied to religious or charitable purposes without the taxable territories, but in the following cases, 
namely: — 
(i) where the property is held under trust or other legal obligation created before the commencement of the -Indian 
Income -tax (Amendment) Act,  1953 (XXV of 1953), and the income therefrom is applied to such purposes without 
the taxable territories; and  
(ii) where the property is held under trust or other legal obligation created after such commencement, and the 
income therefrom is applied withou t the taxable territories to charitable purposes which tend to promote 
international welfare in which India is interested,  
the Central Board of Revenue may, by general or special order, direct that it shall not be included in the total 
income;]  
(b) in the case of income derived from business carried on on behalf of a religious or charitable institution, unless 
the income is applied wholly for the purposes of the institution and either — 
(i) the business is carried on in the course of the actual carrying out of a primary purpose of the institution, or  
(ii) the work in connection with the business is mainly carried on by beneficiaries of the institution;  
(c) if it is applied to purposes other than religious or charitable purposes or ceases to be accumulated or set apart 
for application thereto in which case it shall be deemed to be the income of the year in which it is so applied or 
ceases to be so accumulated or set apart.]”

in part for such purposes. Business is also property within the meaning of 
said clause. Clause  (b) of the proviso to section 4(3)(i) applies only to 
business not hel d in trust but carried on on behalf of religious or 
charitable  institutions.”  
 
8. The old Act defined ‘charitable purpose’ under Section 4(3) - i.e., the 
definition as it stood just prior to the IT Act, 1961 coming into force (thereby 
replacing the old Act) - as follows:  
“4 (3)  Any income, profits or gains falling within the following classes shall 
not be included in the total income of the person receiving them  
* * *  
In this sub -section “charitable purpose” includes relief of the poor, 
education, medical relief and the advancement of any other object of general 
public utility, but not hing contained in clause (i) or clause (ii) shall operate 
to exempt from the provisions of this Act that part of the income from property 
held under a trust or other legal obligation for private religious purposes 
which does not enure for the benefit of th e public.”  
 
This court had occasion to interpret the meaning of the expression “ advancement 
of any other object of general public utility” in CIT v. Andhra Chamber of 
Commerce9. The court considered previous decisions in: In Re: Trustees of the 
Tribune (supra)   and All India Spinners Association of Mirzapur v. CIT10. Relying 
heavily on the decision of the Privy Council in  In Re: Trustees of the Tribune 
(supra) , this court held, in  Andhra Chamber of Commerce that GPU objects 
included  all objects promoting  welfare of general public, including  taking steps 
to oppose or urge legislation affecting trade, commerce , etc.  
 
B. The new law: Income Tax Act, 1961  
9. Section 2 (15) of the IT Act (which came into force on 01.04.1962 and 
repealed the old IT Act) defined “charitable purpose” as follows:  
 “(15) ― charitable purpose includes relief of the poor, education, medical 
relief, and the advancement of any other object of general public uti lity not 
involving the carrying on of any activity for profit.”

10. The then Finance Minister , Mr. Morarji Desai, explained the rationale for 
the new definition  on the floor of Lok Sabha:  
“The definition of ‘charitable purpose’ in that clause is at presen t so widely 
worded that it can be taken advantage of even by commercial concerns which, 
while ostensibly serving a public purpose, get fully paid for the benefits 
provided by them, namely, the newspaper industry which while running its 
concern on commercia l line can claim that by circulating newspapers it was 
improving the general knowledge of the public. In order to prevent the misuse 
of this definition in such cases, the Select Committee felt that the words ‘not 
involving the carrying on of any activity f or profit’ should be added to the 
definition. ”11 
 
11. The first major decision to interpret the new definition was Sole Trustee, 
Lok Shikshana Trust  v. Commissioner of Income Tax12 (hereafter “ Lok Shikshana 
Trust ”). This court turned down a contention that newspaper business, carried on 
with several other objects (which included setting up of educational institutions, 
dissemination of knowledge to the Kannada speaking public through newspaper, 
etc.) was charitable. The court noticed  the chang ed definition :  
“7.…The result thus of the change in the definition is that in order to bring a 
case within the fourth category of charitable purpose, it would be necessary 
to show that (1) the purpose of the trust is the advancement of any other object 
of general public utility, and (2) the above purpose does not involve the 
carrying on of any activity for profit. Both the above conditions must be 
fulfilled before the purpose of the trust can be held to be charitable purpose.

9. It is true t hat there are some business activities like mutual insurance and 
co-operative stores of which profit -making is not an essential ingredient, but 
that is so because of a self -imposed and innate restriction on making profit in 
the carrying on of that particul ar type of business.  Ordinarily profit motive is 
a normal incidence of business activity and if the activity of a trust consists 
of carrying on of a business and there are no restrictions on its making profit, 
the court would be well justified in assuming in the absence of some indication 
to the contrary that the object of the trust involves the carrying on of an 
activity for profit…….. By the use of the expression ‘profit motive’ it is not 
intended that profit must in fact be earned. Nor does the expressio n cover a 
mere desire to make some monetary gain out of a transaction or even a series

of transactions. It predicates a motive which pervades the whole series of 
transactions effected by the person in the course of his activity ….” 
The court also rejected t he submission that the “profit” referred to meant private  
profit. It held that the term had to be interpreted without qualification.  
12. One of the judges - Beg, J, concurred with the majority, but after noticing 
that the trust deed did not contain any condition on profit -making, expressed a 
slightly different view emphasizing that the actual activity  needs to be considered , 
rather than the  absence or existence of any condition, in the trust deed.  
13. The next decision of importance is  Indian Chamber of Commerce v. CIT13. 
The appellant -chamber was a company registered under Section 25 of the Indian 
Companies Act, 1913. Its memorandum and articles of association stipulated 
certain broad objects, which this court agreed fell within the expression “the 
advancement of any … object of general public utility”  in Section 2(15) of the 
Act. The objects were “promotional and protective of Indian trade interests and 
other allied service operations”.  A residual clause authorised the chamber “to do 
all other things as may be conducive to the development of trade, commerce and 
industries or incidental to attainment of the above objects or any of them”. As 
per clauses (4) and (8) of the memorandum of association , the chamber’s member 
could not stand to gain personally since no portion of  
“income and property of the association shall be paid  … directly or 
indirectly, by way of dividend or bonus or otherwise howsoever by “way of 
profit to the persons who at any time are ... members of the Association ....”  
 
On dissolution of the association , the members could not claim any share in the 
assets. The chamber, conceded before this court, that it “by and large, strives to 
advance the general trade interests of India and Indian without seeking to make 
profits for its members.” This court denied the  exemption claimed, holding that:  
“14… The attainment of that object shall not involve activities for profit. 
What then is an activity for profit? An undertaking by a business organisation 
is ordinarily assumed to be for profit unless expressly or by neces sary

implication or by eloquent surrounding circumstances the making of profit 
stands loudly negatived. We will illustrate to illumine. If there is a restrictive 
provision in the bye -laws of the charitable organisation which insists that the 
charges levied  for services of public utility rendered are to be on a ‘no profit” 
basis, it clearly earns the benefit of Section 2(15). For instance, a funeral 
home, an S.P.C.A. or a cooperative may render services to the public but 
write a condition into its constituti on that it shall not charge more than is 
actually needed for the rendering of the services, — maybe it may not be an 
exact equivalent, such mathematical precision being impossible in the case of 
variables, — maybe a little surplus is left over at the end o f the year — the 
broad inhibition against making profit is a good guarantee that the carrying 
on of the activity is not  for profit. As an antithesis, take a funeral home or an 
animal welfare organisation or a super bazaar run for general public utility 
by an institution which charges large sums and makes huge profits. 
Indubitably they render services of general public utility. Their objects are 
charitable but their activities are for profit … 
            **********  
16. To sum up, Section 2(15) excludes from exemption the carrying on of 
activities for profit even if they are linked with the objectives of general public 
utility, because the statute interdicts, for purposes of tax relief, the 
advancement of such objects by  involvement in the carrying on of activities 
for profit. We appreciate the involved language we use, but when legislative 
draftsmanship declines to be simple, interpretative complexity becomes a 
judicial necessity.  
**********  
21. The true test is to ask f or answers to the following questions: (a) Is the 
object of the assessee one of general public utility? (b) Does the advancement 
of the object involve activities bringing in moneys? (c) If so, are such 
activities undertaken (i) for profit or (ii) without p rofit? Even if (a) and (b) 
are answered affirmatively, if (c)(i) is answered affirmatively, the claim for 
exemption collapses. The solution to the problem of an activity being 
one for or irrespective of profit is gathered on a footing of facts. What is the  
real nature of the activity? One which is ordinarily carried on by ordinary 
people for gain? Is there a built -in prescription in the constitution against 
making a profit? Has there been in practice, profit from this venture? 
Although, this last is a weak test. The mere fact that a service is rendered is 
no answer to chargeability because all income is often derived by rendering 
some service or other.”  
 
C. The judgment in Surat Art Silk  
14. The judgment by a larger, five -judge Bench, in Assistant Commissioner v. 
Surat Art Silk Cloth Manufacturers’ Association14 (hereafter “ Surat Art Silk” ) 
was the most important decision rendered on the issue . Here a Section 25 ( of the 
Companies Act, 1956 corresponding to Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013)

14 (1980) 2 SCC 31  (hereafter “ Surat Art Silk” )

non-profit compa ny was established. It  claim ed exemption as an institution  with  
charitable purposes as its objectives. The objects of the company included 
promoting  commerce and tr ade in Art Silk yarn, raw silk, cotton yarn, Art Silk 
cloth, silk cloth, and cotton cloth, among other objects15.Clause 5(1) of the 
company’s memorandum provided that its income and property wheresoever 
derived was to be applied “ solely for the promotion o f its objects as set forth in 
the Memorandum” ; Clause 5(2) directed that no portion of the income or property 
could be paid or transferred, directly or indirectly, by way of dividend, bonus, or 
otherwise by way of profit, to persons, who at any time are or had been members 
of the assessee. The Income  Tax Appellate Tribunal (hereafter “ITAT”) after 
initial remand to the Appellate Commissioner, held that “the primary purpose for 
which the assessee was  established was to promote commerce and trade in Art 
Silk and Silk Yarn and Cloth” . The ITAT made a dir ect reference of the issue, to 
this court, since a conflict existed with regard to the correct interpretation of the 
residual clause, i.e., institutions engaged in the advancement of objects of general 
public utility, and whether the company was entitled t o be assessed as one 
carrying on activities that amounted to charitable purposes. This court first 
determined that the primary or dominant object  of the company was promotion 
and development of trade in silk, silk cloth, yarn and other such items and that 
the other objects were subsidiary to this primary object. It then held that the 
requirement of absence  of profit motive, was satisfied:  
“7...but this requirement was also satisfied in the case of the assessee, 
because the object of private profit was elimi nated by the recognition of the 
 
15 The list of objects were as follows:  
“(a) To promote commerce and trade in Art Silk Yarn, Raw Silk, Cotton Yarn, Art Silk Cloth, Silk Cloth 
and Cotton Cloth.  
(b) To carry on all and any of the business of Art Silk Yarn, Raw Silk, Cotton Yarn as well as Art Silk 
Cloth, Silk Cloth and Cotton Cloth belonging to and on behalf of the members.  
(c) To obtain import licences for import of Art Silk Yarn, Raw Silk, Cotton Ya rn and other raw materials 
as well as accessories required by the members for the manufacture of Art Silk, Silk and Cotton Fabrics.  
(d) To obtain export licences and export cloth manufactured by the members.  
(e) To buy and sell and deal in all kinds of clo th and other goods and fabrics belonging to and on behalf 
of the members.  
(n) To do all other lawful things as are incidental or conducive to the attainment of the above objects.”  

assessee under section 25 of the Companies Act, 1956 and clauses 5 and 10 
of its Memorandum. It must, therefore, be held that the income and property 
of the assessee were held under a legal obligation for the purpose of 
adva ncement of an object of general public utility within the meaning of 
section 2 clause (15).”  
 
15. This court then held that the words of prohibition occurring at the end of 
Section 2(15) were applicable to the last category of charitable institutions, i.e. , 
those involved in the advancement of objects of general public utility. It further 
clarified that  the prohibition applied to the object and not the advancement or 
attainment  of the said object : 
“10a. It is clear on a plain natural construction of the language used by the 
legislature that the ten crucial words “not involving the carrying on of any 
activity for profit” go with “object of general pub lic utility” and not with 
“advancement”. It is the object of general public utility whi ch must not 
involve the carrying on of any activity for profit and not its advancement or 
attainment. What is inhibited by these last ten words is the linking of activity 
for profit with the object of general public utility and not its linking with the 
accomplishment or carrying out of the object. It is not necessary that the 
accomplishment of the object or the means to carry out the object should not 
involve an activity for profit. That is not the mandate of the newly added 
words. What these words require is that the object should not involve the 
carrying on of any activity for profit. The emphasis is on the object of general 
public utility and not on its accomplishment or attainment. The decisions of 
the Kerala and Andhra Pradesh High Courts in  CIT v. Coch in Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry  [(1973) 87 ITR 83 : (Ker)16 and A.P. State Road 
Transport Corporation  v. CIT [(1975) 100 ITR 392 (AC)], in our opinion lay 
down the correct interpretation of the last ten words in Section 2 clause(15). 
The true meaning o f these last ten words is that when the purpose of a trust 
or institution is the advancement of an object of general public utility, it is 
that object of general public utility and not its accomplishment or carrying 
out which must not involve the carrying on of any activity for profit.”  
 
16. The court then went on to hold what is meant by “ not involving the carrying 
on an activity for profit” :  
“15. …The question that is necessary to be asked for this purpose is as to 
when can the purpose of a trust or institution be said to involve the carrying 
on of any activity for profit. The word “involve” according to the  Shorter 
Oxford Dictionary  means “to enwra p in anything, to enfold or envelop; to 
contain or imply”. The activity for profit must, therefore, be intertwined or 
wrapped up with or implied in the purpose of the trust or institution or in 
other words it must be an integral part of such purpose. But t he question 
again is what do we understand by these verbal labels or formulae; what is it 
 
16 This decision was reversed in Indian Chamber of Commerce v . Commissioner o f Income Tax  (1976) 1 SCC 324  

precisely that they mean? Now there are two possible ways of looking at this 
problem of construction. One interpretation is that according to the definition 
what is n ecessary is that the purpose must be of such a nature that it involves 
the carrying on of any activity for profit in the sense that it cannot be achieved 
without carrying on an activity for profit. On this view, if the purpose can be 
achieved without the t rust or institution engaging itself in an activity for 
profit, it cannot be said that the purpose involves the carrying on of an activity 
for profit…  
******************      **************  
16. The other interpretation is to see whether the purpose of the t rust or 
institution in fact involves the carrying on of an activity for profit or in other 
words whether an activity for profit is actually carried on as an integral part 
of the purpose or to use the words of Chandrachud, J, as he then was 
in Dharmodayam c ase [(1977) 4 SCC 75] , “as a matter of advancement of 
the purpose”. There must be an activity for profit and it must be involved in 
carrying out the purpose of the trust or institution or to put it differently, it 
must be carried on in order to advance th e purpose or in the course of 
carrying out the purpose of the trust or institution. It is then that the inhibition 
of the exclusionary clause would be attracted. This appears to us to be a more 
plausible construction which gives meaning and effect to the l ast concluding 
words added by the legislature and we prefer to accept it. Of course, there is 
one qualification which must be mentioned here and it is that if the 
constitution of a trust or institution expressly provides that the purpose shall 
be carried o ut by engaging in an activity which has a predominant profit 
motive, as, for example, where the purpose is specifically stated to be 
promotion of sports by holding cricket matches on commercial lines with a 
view to making profit, there would be no scope fo r controversy, because the 
purpose would, on the face of it, involve carrying on of an activity for profit 
and it would be non -charitable even though no activity for profit is actually 
carried on or, in the example given, no cricket matches are in fact org anised.  
17. The next question that arises is as to what is the meaning of the 
expression “activity for profit”. Every trust or institution must have a purpose 
for which it is established and every purpose must for its accomplishment 
involve the carrying on  of an activity. The activity must, however, be for profit 
in order to attract the exclusionary clause and the question therefore is when 
can an activity be said to be one  for profit? The answer to the question 
obviously depends on the correct connotation of the preposition “for”. This 
preposition has many shades of meaning but when used with the active 
participle of a verb it means “for the purpose of” and connotes the end with 
reference to which something is done. It is not therefore enough that as a 
matter of fact an activity results in profit but it must be carried on with the 
object of earning profit. Profit -making must be the end to which the activity 
must be directed or in other words, the predominant object of the activity must 
be making a profit. Wh ere an activity is not pervaded by profit motive but is 
carried on primarily for serving the charitable purpose, it would not be 
correct to describe it as an activity for profit. But where, on the other hand, 
an activity is carried on with the predominant object of earning profit, it 
would be an activity for profit, though it may be carried on in advancement 
of the charitable purpose of the trust or institution. Where an activity is 
carried on as a matter of advancement of the charitable purpose or for the 

purpose of carrying out the charitable purpose, it would not be incorrect to 
say as a matter of plain English grammar that the charitable purpose involves 
the carrying on of such activity, but the predominant object of such activity 
must be to subserve the  charitable purpose and not to earn profit. The 
charitable purpose should not be submerged by the profit making motive; the 
latter should not masquerade under the guise of the former….”  
 
17. The court took note of the judgment of Pathak, J. in  Dharmadeepti  v. CIT17  
as well as the speech of then then Finance Minister, and further observed:   
“17. ….It is obvious that the exclusionary clause was added with a view to 
overcoming the decision of the Privy Council in the  Tribune case  [AIR 1939 
PC 208: In Re the T rustees of the Tribune, (1939) 7 ITR 415] where it was 
held that the object of supplying the community with an organ of educated 
public opinion by publication of a newspaper was an object of general public 
utility and hence charitable in character, even th ough the activity of 
publication of the newspaper was carried on commercial lines with the object 
of earning profit. The publication of the newspaper was an activity engaged 
in by the trust for the purpose of carrying out its charitable purpose and on 
the facts it was clearly an activity which had profit making as its predominant 
object, but even so it was held by the Judicial Committee that since the 
purpose served was an object of general public utility, it was a charitable 
purpose. It is clear from the s peech of the Finance Minister that it was with a 
view to setting at naught this decision that the exclusionary clause was added 
in the definition of “charitable purpose”. The test which has, therefore, now 
to be applied is whether the predominant object of  the activity involved in 
carrying out the object of general public utility is to subserve the charitable 
purpose or to earn profit. Where profit making is the predominant object of 
the activity, the purpose, though an object of general public utility, wou ld 
cease to be a charitable purpose. But where the predominant object of the 
activity is to carry out the charitable purpose and not to earn profit, it would 
not lose its character of a charitable purpose merely because some profit 
arises from the activity . The exclusionary clause does not require that the 
activity must be carried on in such a manner that it does not result in any 
profit. It would indeed be difficult for persons in charge of a trust or 
institution to so carry on the activity that the expend iture balances the income 
and there is no resulting profit…..  
 
18. The court proceeded to quote from passages in its previous judgments, in 
Lok Shikshana Trust and Indian Chamber of Commerce (supra) to the effect that 
if the activity of a trust consists of carrying on a business and there are no 
restrictions on profit -making, the court could assume (in the absence of 
something to the contrary) that the trust’s object involved carrying on of an

activity for profit. The Constitution Bench disagreed with the approach in both 
the previous judgments, and observed:  
“19. …Now we entirely agree with the learned Judges who decided these two 
cases that activity involved in carrying out the charitable purpose must not 
be motivated by a profit objective but it must be undertaken for the purpose 
of advancement or carrying out of the charitable purpose. But we find it 
difficult to accept their thesis that whenever an activity is carried on which  
yields profit, the inference must necessarily be drawn, in the absence of some 
indication to the contrary, that the activity is  for profit and the charitable 
purpose involves the carrying on of an activity for profit. We do not think the 
Court would be ju stified in drawing any such inference merely because the 
activity results in profit. It is in our opinion not at all necessary that there 
must be a provision in the constitution of the trust or institution that the 
activity shall be carried on no profit no  loss basis or that profit shall be 
proscribed. Even if there is no such express provision, the nature of the 
charitable purpose, the manner in which the activity for advancing the 
charitable purpose is being carried on and the surrounding circumstances 
may clearly indicate that the activity is not propelled by a dominant profit 
motive. What is necessary to be considered is whether having regard to all 
the facts and circumstances of the case, the dominant object of the activity is 
profit making or carrying out a charitable purpose. If it is the former, the 
purpose would not be a charitable purpose, but, if it is the latter, the 
charitable character of the purpose would not be lost.   
20. If we apply this test in the present case, it is clear that the activity  of 
obtaining licences for import of foreign yarn and quotas for purchase of 
indigenous yarn, which was carried on by the assessee, was not an activity 
for profit. The predominant object of this activity was promotion of commerce 
and trade in Art Silk Yarn , Raw Silk, Cotton Yarn, Art Silk Cloth, Silk Cloth 
and Cotton Cloth, which was clearly an object of general public utility and 
profit was merely a bye -product which resulted incidentally in the process of 
carrying out the charitable purpose. It is signifi cant to note that the assessee 
was a Company recognised by the Central Government under Section 25 of 
the Companies Act, 1956 and under its Memorandum of Association, the 
profit arising from any activity carried on by the assessee was liable to be 
applied solely and exclusively for the promotion of trade and commerce in 
various commodities which we have mentioned above and no part of such 
profit could be distributed amongst the members in any form or under any 
guise. The profit of the assessee could be util ised only for the purpose of 
feeding this charitable purpose and the dominant and real object of the 
activity of the assessee being the advancement of the charitable purpose, the 
mere fact that the activity yielded profit did not alter the charitable chara cter 
of the assessee. We are of the view that the Tribunal was right in taking the 
view that the purpose for which the assessee was established was a charitable 
purpose within the meaning of Section 2 clause (15) and the income of the 
assessee was exempt f rom tax under Section 11. The question referred to us 

in each of these references must, therefore, be answered in favour of the 
assessee and against the Revenue.”  
 
19. There was, however, a discordant note in Surat Art Silk  - A.P. Sen, J 
disagreed with the majority, and delivered a dissenting opinion. Explaining how 
there were no restrictive words or conditions, under the old IT Act, the learned 
judge held that the approach indicated in Lok Shikshana Trust  and Indian 
Chamber  of Commerce were correct. He felt that the previous decisions of the 
court were not relevant, and that if the activities of a trust involved any activity 
for profit or business, the organization ceased to be charitable, and that such 
proceeds were utilize d for charitable objects, were not relevant. He also noted 
that “A reading of Section 2(15) and Section 11 together shows that what is 
frowned upon is an activity for profit by a charity established for advancement of 
an object of general public utility in  the course of accomplishing its objects.”  The 
same judgment also stated that:  
“if the object of the trust is advancement of an object of general public utility and it 
carried on any activity for profit, it is excluded from the ambit of charitable purpose 
defined in Section 2(15). The distinction is clearly brought out by the provision 
contained in Section 13(1)(bb) inserted by Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 1975.”  
 
D. Relevant changes brought about to the IT Act, 1961 (Finance Act, 1983 
and 1991 ) 
20. It is pertinent to note that the judgment in Surat Art Silk was delivered on 
19.11.1979. The expression “not involving the carrying on of any activity for 
profit ” in Section 2(15) of the IT Act, was omitted by the Finance Act, 1983, 
w.e.f. 01.04.1984 . Prior to this, w.e.f. 01.04.1977 the following restrictive 
condition had been inserted18 as clause (bb) , to Section 13(1)19: 
“(bb) in the case of a charitable trust or institution for the relief of the poor, 
education or medical relief, which carries on any business, any income

derived from such business, unless the business is carried on in the course of 
the actual carrying out  of a primary purpose of the trust or institution”  
 
This provision had the effect of excluding or excepting the operation of Section 
income ). The restrictive condition in clause (bb) was also omitted by the Finance 
Act, 1983 , w.e.f. 01.04.1984.   
21. Below Section 11(4)20 (as it originally stood in the IT Act, 1961), Section 
11(4A)21 was inserted by the Finance Act, 1983, w.e.f. 01.04.1984. Subsequently, 
Section 11(4A) was amended and substituted by the following provision w.e.f. 
01.04.1992 (and continues to be in force):  
“(4A) Sub -section (1) or sub -section (2) or sub -section (3) or sub-section (3A) 
shall not apply in relation to any income of a trust or an institution, being 
profits and gains of business, unless the business is incidental to the 
attainment of the objectives of the trust or, as the case may be, institution, and 
separa te books of account are maintained by such trust or institution in 
respect of such business.”  
E. The judgment in Thanthi Trust  
22. This court comprehensively interpreted these provisions as they existed, in 
different time periods, in Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax v. Thanthi 
Trust22 where this court had to decide whether the assessee trust, created for 
establishing a newspaper “as an organ of educated public opinion for the Tamil 
 
20 Section 11(4) as originally enacted, reads as follows:  
“For the purposes of this section ‘property held under trust’ includes a business undertaking so held, and where 
a claim is made that the income of any such undertaking shall not be included in the t otal income of the persons 
in receipt thereof, the Income Tax Officer shall have power to determine the income of such undertaking in 
accordance with the provisions of this Act relating to assessment; and where any income so determined is in 
excess of the income as shown in the accounts of the undertaking, such excess shall be deemed to be applied to 
purposes other than charitable or religious purposes .” 
21 Earlier, sub -section (4A) was inserted by the Finance Act, 1983, w.e.f. 01.04.1984, and read as follows:  
“(4A) Sub-section (1) or sub -section (2) or sub -section (3) or sub -section (3A) shall not apply in relation to any 
income of a trust or an institution , being profits and gains of business, unless  
(a) the business is carried on by a trust wholly for public religious purposes and the business consists of 
printing and publication of books or is of a kind notified by the Central Government in this behalf in the  
Official Gazette;  
(b) the business is carried on by an institution wholly for charitable purposes and the work in connection 
with the business is mainly carried on by the beneficiaries of the institution;  
and separate books of accounts are maintained by the t rust or institution in respect of such business”

reading public and to disseminate news and to ventilate opinion upon all matters 
of public interest through it.” could avail of tax exemption.  In 1957, the settl or 
executed a supplementary deed making th e trust irrevocable. On 28.07.1961 
another supplementary deed was executed which directed that the trust’s surplus 
income (after defraying all expenses), should be devoted to purposes such as 
establishing and running a school or college for the teaching of  journalism; 
establishing and/or running or helping to run schools, colleges or other 
educational institutions for teaching arts and science; establishing of scholarships 
for students of journalism, arts and science; establishing and/or running or 
helping to run hostels for students; establishing and/or running or helping to run 
orphanages; and other educational purposes. The High Court held that exemption 
could be claimed by the trust. The revenue appealed. This court noticed that the 
appeals covered three  distinct periods - (i) 1979 -80 to 1983 -84, (ii) 1984 -85 to 
1991 -92, and (ii) 1992 -93 to 1996 -97. This court held that for the first period 
(1979 -80 to 1983 -84), the activity of running a newspaper, and the corpus held 
for it, by the trust, did not directly  result in carrying on the educational activities 
mentioned in the supplementary deeds. The income was found to only feed such 
activity, which was not the same as carrying on in the course of actual 
accomplishment of the trust’s objects of education and re lief of poor, and thus not 
entitled to exemption. For the next period (1984 -85 to 1991 -92), noting that 
Section 11(4) continued to be in existence [ despite  Section 11(4A) being inserted 
(as originally enacted w.e.f. 01.04.1984)], dealing with the expressio n “property 
held under trust”, and held that:  
“23....Trusts and institutions are separately dealt with in the Act (Section 11 
itself and sections 12, 12A and 13, for example). The expressions refer to 
entities differently constituted. It is thus clear that the newspaper business 
that is carried on by the Trust does not fall within sub -section (4A). The Trust 
is not only for public religious purposes so it does not fall within clause (a). 
It is a Trust not an institution, so it does not fall within claus e (b). It must, 
therefore, be held that for the assessment years in question the Trust was not 
entitled to the exemption contained in section 11 in respect of the income of 
its newspaper.”  

 
23. For the third period  (1992 -93 to 1996 -97), the court dealt wit h the meaning 
and effect of Section 11(4A) (amended and substituted w.e.f. 01.04.1992) and 
held that the assessee trust was entitled to be treated as a charity:  
“25. The substituted sub -section (4A) states that the income derived from a 
business held under  Trust wholly for charitable or religious purposes shall 
not be included in the total income of the previous year of the Trust or 
institution if "the business is incidental to the attainment of the objective of 
the Trust or, as the case may be, institution " and separate books of account 
are maintained in respect of such business. Clearly, the scope of sub -section 
(4A) is more beneficial to a Trust or institution than was the scope of sub -
section (4A) as originally enacted. In fact, it seems to us that the s ubstituted 
sub-section (4A) gives Trust or institution a greater benefit than was given by 
section 13(1)(bb). If the object of Parliament was to give Trusts and 
institutions no more benefit than that given by section 13(1)(bb), the language 
of section 13(1 )(bb) would have been employed in the substituted sub -section 
(4A). As it stands, all that it requires for the business income of a Trust or 
institution to be exempt is that the business should be incidental to the 
attainment of the objectives of the Trust  or institution. A business whose 
income is utilized by the Trust or the institution for the purposes of achieving 
the objectives of the Trust or the institution is, surely, a business which is 
incidental to the attainment of the objectives of the Trust . In any event, if there 
be any ambiguity in the language employed, the provision must be construed 
in a manner that benefits the assessee. The Trust, therefore, is entitled to the 
benefit of section 11 for the assessment year 1992 -93 and thereafter. It is, w e 
should add, not in dispute that the income of its newspaper business has been 
employed to achieve its objectives of education and relief to the poor and that 
it has maintained separate books of account in respect thereof.”  
       (emphasis  supplied)  
F. Deletion of certain exemptions:  Section 10 (20A) and Section 10 (23)  
24. Section 10(20A) had been inserted by the Finance Act, 1970, w.e.f. 
01.04.1962; it exempted certain classes of income earned by housing boards, etc., 
and before deletion re ad as follows:  
“(20A) any income of an authority constituted in India by or under any law 
enacted either for the purpose of dealing with and satisfying the need for 
housing accommodation or for the purpose of planning, development or 
improvement of cities,  towns and villages, or for both;”  
 

25. Similarly, Section 10 (23)23 existed and provided exemption to income 
earned by sport controlling boards, and associations, subject to specific 
conditions. Section 10(23) read as follows, before its deletion:  
“(23) any income of an association or institution established in India which 
may be notified by the Central Government in the Official Gazette having 
regard to the fact that the association or institution has as its object the 
control, supervision, regulation or encouragement in India of the games of 
cricket, hockey, football , tennis or such other games or sports as the Central 
Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify in this 
behalf:”  
26. Section 10(20A) and 10(23) were deleted/omitted by Finance Act, 2002, 
w.e.f. 01.04.2003.  While both these provisions  are not directly relevant for 
deciding the primary question (i.e., as to what  charitable purpose is , under Section 
in view of the circumstances that the provisions were del eted w.e.f. 01.04.2003, 
housing boards, and bodies, as well as sports associations, that were earlier 
claiming exemption of their income under these provisions, now sought to claim 
that they were charities.  
G. Amendments to Section 2 (15) by Finance Act, 2008 (w.e.f. 01.04.2009)  
27. Section 2(15) - which had been amended last, in 198324, was again 
amended, by Finance Act, 2008, w.e.f. 01.04.2009. Some other amendments too 
were made, with effect from the same date by the Finance Act, 2009 and Finance 
Act, 2 010. With the said amendments, as on 01.04.2009, the provision read as 
follows:  
(15) “charitable purpose” includes relief of the poor, education, medical 
relief, [preservation of environment (including watersheds, forests and

01.04.1990; and further amended by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1991, w.r.e.f. 01.04.1990; Finance Act, 1992, w.r.e.f. 
01.04.1990/w.e.f. 01.04.1992; and Finance Act, 2000, w.e.f. 1 -4-2001.  
24 Deletion of the expression “ not involving the carrying on of any activity for profit ” and the resulting Section 
2(15) read as follows:  
““charitable purpose” includes relief of the poor, education, medical relief, and the advancement of any other 
object of general public utility.”

historic interest, and the advancement of any other object of general public 
utility:  
Provided that the advancement of any other object of general public 
utility shall not be a charitable purpose, if it involv es the carrying on of any 
activity in the nature of trade, commerce or business, or any activity of

[Provided further that the first proviso shall not apply if the aggregate 
value of the receipts from the activities referred to therein is [ten lakh rupees] 
or less in the previous year;]  
In the s econd proviso, the reference to ten lakhs was substituted, and the figure 
of rupees twenty -five lakhs, was inserted, by  the Finance Act, 2011 (w.e.f. 
01.04.2012). By Finance Act, 2015 (w.e.f. 01.04.2016), the first two provisos to 
Section 2(15) were delete d, and instead, the following proviso was inserted:  
“Provided that the advancement of any other object of general public utility 
shall not be a charitable purpose, if it involves the carrying on of any activity 
in the nature of trade, commerce or business, or any activity of rendering any 
service in relatio n to any trade, commerce or business, for a cess or fee or 
any other consideration, irrespective of the nature of use or application, or 
retention, of the income from such activity, unless —  
(i) such activity is undertaken in the course of actual carrying out of such 
advancement of any other object of general public utility; and  
(ii) the aggregate receipts from such activity or activities during the previous year, do 
not exceed twenty per cent of the total receipts, of the trust or institution undertaking 
such activity or activities, of that previous year;”  
Additionally, the same amendment also inserted “yoga” (after “education”) as a 
listed category of charitable activity, in the substantive provision.   
II. Submissions of parties  
A. Arguments on behalf of the revenue  
28. The learned Additional Solicitor General, Mr. N. Venkataraman (hereafter 
“ASG”) tracing the genesis of Section 2(15) contended that the old IT Act 
contained no restrictive expressions forbidding trade or business activities by 
charities. He argued that decisions in  In Re: Trustees of the Tribune , Andhra 
Chamber of Commerce and the decision in Krishna Warri ar (supra) were in light 

of Section 4(3) of the old Act; therefore, the contextual framework of this court’s 
decisions was entirely different. Those decisions cons equently did not rule out 
carrying on of activities akin to business, by charitable institutions established to 
advance general public utility.  
29. The ASG next submitted that Parliament’s intent, in changing the law, wa s 
to expressly forbid  the tax exemption benefit if the entity was “involved” in 
carrying on trade or business. The revenue relied on the two decisions in  Lok 
Shikshana Trust , and Indian Chamber of Commerce  (supra) , highlighting that the 
significance of the change – brought about by  Section 2(15) of the IT Act – was 
noticed. Particular reliance was placed on the observations of Beg, J in Lok 
Shikshana Trust and the passages in Indian Chamber of Commerce to urge that 
the involvement of an entity in the carrying on of activities for pr ofit, even if for 
advancement of  charitable purpose or object, disentitl ed it to tax exemption . The 
learned ASG urged that this court  had recognized – from its earlier decisions – 
that the prohibition from carrying on trade or commerce activities applied o nly to 
charities meant to advance general public utility and not the other categories such 
as education, medical relief , or relief to the poor (which are per se exempt).  
30. The ASG submitted that the judgments in Indian Chamber of Commerce 
and Lok Shiksha na Trust  (supra) were conscious of the generality  of the GPU 
category  which led Parliament to insert the restrictive words "not involving the 
carrying on of any activity for profit ”. It was argued  that Parliament amended  the 
definition due to rampant abuse of the law by businesses  claiming to be driven by 
charitable purposes.  Often, charities would be created merely to secure exemption 
from tax, and would carry on large commercial activities, enjoying the profits . 
This led Par liament to embed the exclusionary terms, depriving exemption if the 
institution otherwise fell under the GPU category  charity, but undertook activities 
for profit. The ASG relied on the Finance Minister's speech in the House at the 
time of the introduction  of the IT Act, and submitted that it outlines the rationale  

for the restrictive condition  noting that units  run on commercial lines could claim 
that some general public  utility was promoted and claim exemption . The Select 
Committee of Parliament (at that time), felt that to prevent misuse of the 
definition in such cases, the words “not involving the carrying on of any  activity 
for profit” should be added to the definition. ASG relied on Lok Shikshana Trust  
(supra) which highlighted that this statement shed light on the new provision.  
31. It was submitted that Indian Chamber of Commerce (supra) recognized this 
legislative history, and also held that the interpretation of the provision had to be 
in tune with  the advancement of the object of the changed law. The court also 
was conscious that there were borderline cases which posed difficulty in deciding 
ex facie  whether the undertaking yielding profit is a “deceptive”  device or a 
bonafide  venture resulting “in nominal surplus although substantially intended 
only to advance the charitable object” . The court also held that the restrictive 
condition was a “term of art and embraces objects of general public utility” . Yet, 
under the garb of charitable purposes, orga nisations masking profit, sprang up. 
The mask was charitable, but the “heart was hunger for tax free profit” . The 
revenue highlighted the following reasoning from this court’s judgment in Indian 
Chamber of Commerce  (supra) : 
“by the new definition the benef it of exclusion from total income is taken away 
where in accomplishing a charitable purpose the institution engages itself in 
activities for profit. The Calcutta decisions are right in linking; activities for 
profit with advancement of the object. If you w ant immunity from taxation, 
your means of fulfilling charitable purposes must be unsullied by profit 
making ventures.”  
 
32. It was then urged that before the decision in Surat Art Silk (supra) two 
legislative developments took place, which reinforced the revenue’s view that 
charities cannot engage in commercial activities. The first was the amendment, 
carried out in 1975 to the IT Act (w.e.f. 01.04.1976), which introduced Section 
or institution, established for charitable purposes. The said provision, to the extent 
relevant, is extracted as follows:  

Citations:
10 (23C ) and had the effect of excluding income received by inter alia, any fund

“10. In computing the total income of a previous year of any  person, any 
income falling within any of the following clauses shall not be included — 
*******         ********
     
“(23C)  any income received by any person on behalf of - 
(i) the Prime Minister' s National Relief Fund; or  
*******     *****     *****  
(iv) any other fund or institution established for charitable purposes”  
 
The other amendment was introduction of Section 13(1)(bb) (w.e.f. 01.04.1977) 
which imposed  conditions on the carrying on of business, by charitable 
institutions.  
33.  It was urged that the combined operation of Section 2(15), Section 
10(23C) and Section 13(1)(bb) meant that only charities which were set up for 
the purpose of “ relief of the poor, education or medical relief”, could claim 
exemption if they carried on bus iness “in the course of actual carrying out of a 
primary purpose of the trust or institution” . The studied omission of GPU 
category charities, in Section 13(1)(bb) meant that if such trust or institutions 
carried on any business, even incidental to their o bjects, they would not be 
entitled to exemption.  
34. The ASG then contended that the decision in Surat Art Silk (supra)  had the 
unintended consequence of ignoring the significance of the addition of the 
expression “advancement of any other object of genera l public utility not 
involving the carrying on of any activity for profit” . The remedy intended by 
Parliament, in adding the said terms was to prevent charities (involved in the 
carrying on of any activity for profit) from claiming exemption, and to ensure that 
purely  charitable activity -driven trusts or institutions, could claim exemption. It 
was submitted that the Constitution Bench fell into error, in holding t hat as long 
as the ‘dominant ’ objective of the charity was to promote objects of general public 
utility, they were entitled to exemption.  

35. The ASG further submitted that if the history of the provision, and the 
further amendments were kept in mind, the  question of permitting activities that 
had any business or trade, for consideration, could not arise; however, by later 
amendments, GPU category charities have been permitted to carry on activities 
in the nature of business, for consideration, or service in relation to business and 
commerce, provided that is in the course of actually achieving the charitable 
object, and also that income from such activities (i.e. business, etc .) does not 
exceed 20% of the total receipts.  
36. It was submitted that statutor y corporations, agencies, boards and 
authorities may trace their origins to specific Central or State laws. However, if 
their activities are akin to or “in the nature of” business, or trade, or they provide 
services to businesses or trade, for consideratio n, fee or even cess (since they may 
be enabled to do so by law) they have to fulfil the mandate and restrictions under 
Section 2(15), especially proviso (ii). The ASG cited the larger bench decision in 
New Delhi Municipal Council v. State of Punjab25 (here after “ NDMC ”) to urge 
that state entities are not exempt from Union taxation, if they engage in trade or 
business. It was furthermore submitted that the effect of proviso (i) to Section 
2(15) is that there can be no question of any incidental activity; nor  can the 
proceeds of trade claim to be exempt merely because they are ploughed back to 
feed the charitable object.  
 
B. Arguments of the assessee -organizations  
37. Mr. S.N. Soparkar , learned Senior Advocate appeared for the Ahmedabad 
Urban Development Authority (hereafter “AUDA”); the Gujarat Industrial 
Development Corporation (hereafter “GIDC”) and Gujarat Housing Board 
(hereafter “GHB”). Counsel submitted that all three corporation s were 
established by or under statutes enacted by the Gujarat legislature; they were

treated as local authority under Section 10(20) of the IT Act, as it existed till 2003. 
Thereafter they were treated as charitable institutions engaged in activities 
involved in the advancement of public utility till the amendment of 2008. Learned 
counsel highlighted that the AUDA was created purely for the development and 
redevelopment - as well as for augmentation of roads and allotment of lands after 
redevelopment , in the areas under its control. Relying upon the provisions of the 
Act constituting AUDA26, he submitted that its mandate is to control development 
activities, execution of works and dispersal of sewage, provisions of such other 
facilities and generally engage  in urban development in the areas it had 
jurisdiction over. He highlighted Section 40 of that Act and urged that the nature 
of activities, especially disposal of properties developed by AUDA were entirely 
regulated. Whilst the lion’s shares of properties developed by AUDA were to be 
allotted for housing and residence, and earmarked specifically for public 
amenities, roads etc., a small percentage (15%) could be sold by public auction. 
It was submitted that the statutory model adopted by AUDA was to enable it to 
function as a self -sustaining unit. The disposal of plots through allotment and 
especially by public auction were the main modes through which it could generate 
revenue. The entire revenue or income so generated was to be kept in a fund under 
Section  91; and its accounts were mandatorily audited by the State’s Accountant 
General under Section 95.  
38. It was argued that like AUDA, the GIDC too was also set up by virtue of a 
statute27, i.e. GIDA, 1962 for the purposes of securing and assisting rapid and 
orderly establishment and organisation of industrial areas and estates in Gujarat, 
as well as establishing commercial centres for such industrial areas and estates. 
Like AUDA, its accou nts were audited by the Accountant General; the audited 
report was to be laid before the State legislature (Section 26(4) ) and the land 
developed by the GIDC could be dealt with only in accordance with law, i.e. , the 
 
26 Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act, 1976  
27 Gujarat Industrial Development Act, 1962 (referred to as “GIDA”)  

regulations framed under the GIDA, its constituting enactment, further to Section 
32(2).  As far as GHB is concerned, learned counsel submitted that like the other 
statutory corporations it was also established by virtue of a special law28. The 
functions of this Board were identical to that of A UDA and its mandate is to 
regulate and develop building activities aimed for the purposes of providing 
housing.  
39. Learned counsel urged that none of the three boards carry on any business 
activity; their functions are controlled by the parent enactments under which they 
were created. Furthermore, on advancing of its affairs in such a manner that if 
any surpluses are generated, they were used for furthering the objectives of law. 
Thus, for instance, if surplus is generated in the activities of AUDA, GIDC , or 
GHB, those would not be handed to the State Government, which previously had 
control over them but rather kept in a separate fund to be utilised for further 
development, expansion and development activities by each of such corporations. 
These cannot be construed as carrying on any trade, business or commerce.  
40. It was submitted that the decisions in  In Re: Trustees of the Tribune ; 
Krishna Warri ar and Lok Shikshana Trust (supra)  were all in the context of 
entities which carried on business. Moreover, in the first two decisions, the law 
as it then stood did not contain any restriction prohibiting trade or commerce 
activity. Learned counsel submitted that the judgment in Indian Cham ber of 
Commerce  (supra) was specifically overruled in Surat Art Silk (supra). Therefore, 
it may be treated as having no precedential value on subject. Learned counsel 
highlighted the observations in Surat Art  Silk (supra) and submitted that as long 
as the activities involved are mainly charitable and for advancement of public 
utility, its purposes are deemed to be charitable even if it carries on some business 
or trade -like activities for the purpose of generating income. What is important, 
it was argued, i s whether the main or dominant purpose of business or activity is 
 
28 Gujarat Housing Board Act, 1961.  

motivated by profit. In such cases, the entity is debarred from claiming that it is 
a charity and cannot claim the benefit of tax exemption. Therefore, what is to be 
understood from the rati o in Surat Art Silk (supra) is that the main purpose or 
principal objective or motivation for the activity should not be to carry on trade 
or business. It should be to advance the purpose of general public utility. If such 
a purpose is fulfilled, the carry ing on of some activity which might result in 
surplus, would not  disentitle the entity from the benefit of tax exemption.  
41. Learned counsel then made a brief reference to the judgment in CIT, 
Bombay v. Bar Council of Maharashtra29  arguing that Surat Ar t Silk (supra) was 
followed in this decision. He also cited Thant hi Trust (supra) . Counsel 
highlighted that the object of the assessee there, was charitable and required that 
the business ought to be carried out for the purposes of achieving the charitable 
purpose. Having regard to the nature of Section 13(1)(bb), which existed for the  
relevant period, the court held that the income which the trust derived was through 
a business and it only fed the charity. In this light, the court rejected the trust’s 
contention with respect to the entitlement to claim tax benefit for the first part. 
Counsel pointedly referred to the observations in paragraph 24 of the said 
decision and submitted that the court noticed the difference in language brought 
about by the substitution of Section 11(4A) (w.e.f. 01.04.1992). The new 
provisions enabled the Trust  to carry on business for it was incidental to the 
attainment of its activities.  
42. Elaborating on Thanthi Trust  further, counsel highlighted  that the scope of 
the provision, i.e. Section 11(4A) had been ruled by this court as more beneficial 
to the trust  or institution,  than had existed previously before its amendment. 
Therefore, as long as the Trust carried on its activities mainly for charitable 
purposes - any income derived from incidental trading or business activities, 
 

Citations:
29 (1981) 3 SCC 308  (hereafter “ Bar Council of Maharashtra ”)

would not result in it being ch aracterised as an entity carrying on business; in 
other words, it was one carrying on a charitable objective or purpose.  
43.  Learned counsel also relied upon Circular 11/2008 dated 19.12.2008 which 
highlighted that whether the activities carried on by an y charitable institutions are 
in the nature of trade or whether they are essentially charitable is a question of 
fact. It also spelt out that if an assessee is engaged in any activity, in the nature of 
trade, commerce or business or rendering any services in relation to such trade 
etc., it could not claim that its object was charitable.  In such event, “the object of 
general public utility will only be a means or defence to highlight the true purpose 
which is trade, service or business………….” . It was emphasis ed therefore that 
the circular and the speech of the Finance Minister during the budget clearly 
pointed out organisations, trust or entities which were masquerading as charitable 
but in reality carrying on business. On the other hand, genuine charitable 
organisations which generated income for their sustenance could not be denied 
the benefit of tax exemption under the Income Tax Act.  
44. Counsel relied on the decisions in Shri Ramtanu Cooperative Housing 
Society Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra30, Gujarat Industrial Development 
Corporation v. CIT31 (hereafter " GIDC case "), HSIDC v. Hari Om Enterprises32 
and Commissioner of Central Excise v . Maharashtra Industrial Development 
Corporation33 and urged that statutory organizations set up for housing and other 
essential development, cannot be regarded as commercial or business entities.  
45. Learned counsel relied upon the Constitution Bench decision of this Court 
in Navnit Lal C. Jhaveri v. K.K . Sen34 (hereafter “ Navnit Lal Jhaveri ”), where the 
court had held while interpreting the provisions of an enactment that the 
 
31 1997 (Supp 3) SCR 466 ; (1997) 7 SCC 17  (hereafter " GIDC case ").

executive’s understanding – in the form of circulars in the context of taxing 
statutes – were valuable guides to interpretation. The observations in Navnit Lal 
Jhaveri (supra)  were relied on to submit that the circulars in that case was used 
to in fact soften the rigor of a newly int roduced provision. Learned counsel also 
relied upon the judgment of this Court in UCO Bank Calcutta v. Commissioner 
of Income Tax, West Bengal35 and in Lok Shikshana Trust (supra)  where the Court 
had specifically rejected the contention that a speech made in Parliament cannot 
be looked into to discern the intent of the lawmaker. In that case, the Court had 
stressed that the real meaning of all the words used could be understood 
specifically by referring to the past history of the legislation and the speech of the 
mover of the amendment.  
46. Learned counsel argued that the expressions “trade”, “business” or 
“commerce” always mean and have been interpreted to mean activities driven by 
profit . In this context, reliance was placed on this court’s decisions in State of 
Punjab v. Bajaj Electricals Ltd36.; Khoday Distilleries Ltd. v. State of Karnataka37  
and State of Gujarat v. M/s. Raipur Manufacturing38. It was submitted that in all 
contexts, the primary meaning of the expression “trade” is “exchange of goods” 
for money and connotates that such activity is necessarily or always carried on to 
earn profit. It was, therefore, argued that Section 2(15) cannot be read in isolation, 
but should be construed in the light of the minister’s speech while introducing the 
amendment, and the Circular (i.e. Circular 11/2018). Therefore, if an organisation 
is created and carries on its activities with a view to earn profit as was held in 
Bajaj Electricals , Khoday  Distilleries , and Raipur Manufacturing  (supra), it is 
precluded from claiming to be a charitable organisation. On the other hand, if the 
entity is primarily set up for the charitable purpose, i .e., to carry on activities for 
the advancement of general public utility, but it also carries activities that

generate surplus or money, they cannot be per se excluded from consideration for 
tax benefit.  
47. Learned Senior Counsel Mr. Kavin Gulati argued for NOIDA and relied 
upon the Constitution Bench judgment of this court in Commissioner of  Central 
Excise, Bolpur v. Ratan Melting and Wire Industries39 to urge that a circular 
cannot define an ambit of a provision. He highlighted the decision rendered by 
the Delhi High Court in Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority v. 
Union of India & Ors40, where the assessee’s  activities were held to be not 
“commercial activity” within the meaning of clause (b) to S.10(46).41 He also 
relied on other decisions – of this court, to the same effect, in Kerala State 
Electricity Board v . Indian Aluminium Co. Ltd.42 and Trustees of th e Port of 
Madras v . Aminchand Pyarelal and Ors.43. 
48. Mr. Gulati relied on the GIDC case (supra)  to argue that the word 
“development” in S.10(20 -A) of the IT Act, 1961 has to be understood in its wide 
sense. It was urged that development authorities like NOIDA fall under S ection 
2(15) of the IT Act, 1961 if they satisfy the test in Section 11(7) of t he IT Act, 
1961. It was contended that Surat Art Silk (supra)  was clear that engagement by 
a trust with a commercial activity is not per se prohibited, as long as its object is 
the attainment of an object of general public utility. Pointing to the Explanat ory 
Notes (to the Provisions of the Finance Act, 2015) - with respect to proviso to 
Section 2(15), counsel urged that the proviso operates at the stage of registration 
of trust under Section 12AA(1A) of the IT Act, 1961 , when the authorities satisfy 
themse lves with respect to the genuineness of the activity and scope of the trust.

49. It was lastly argued that the expression “trade” carries within it the idea of 
profitability: counsel cited State of Gujarat v. Mahesh Dhiarjlal Thakkar44, Sodan  
Singh & Ors. v New Delhi Municipal Committee & Ors45 and T.M.A Pai 
Foundation and Ors. v. State of Karnataka & Ors46. Reliance was placed upon 
the judgment in CIT, Madras v. M/s Madurai Mills Company Limited47 to urge 
that interpretation of the definition  of expression “charitable purpose” should not 
be coloured by considerations stemming from legislative history, which  override 
the plain words of a statute.  
50. Mr. K. K. Chythanya, senior counsel appeared for  M/s Karnataka Industrial 
Areas Development Boa rd (“KIADB”). He urged that KIADB was formed under 
Section 5 of the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act, 1966 ( “KIAD

be regarded as trade or business. Reliance was placed upon State of Karnataka v . 
All India Manufacturer’s Organisation52.   
51. It was submitted that in the absence of profit motive, the activity is not 
trade, commerce or business  - within the meaning of first proviso to Section 2(15) 
of the IT  Act, 1961. Reliance was placed upon Khoday Distilleries (supra) , State 
of Tamil Nadu  v. Board of Trustees of the Port of Madras53 and several other 
decisions54. It was argued that wherever it is intended, profit element is wholly 
excluded from activity  - reliance was placed on provisions of the Karnataka VAT 
Act, The Central Goods and Service Tax Act (“CGST Act”) and Section 2(31) of 
the IT Act. In the present context, the activities of the Board do not amount to 
“trade”, “commerce” or “business” and the  first proviso to Section 2(15) is 
attracted only if the primary/dominant objects are (a) in the nature of trade, 
commerce or business; or (b) rendering any service in relation to any trade, 
commerce or business. To substantiate this argument, counsel reli ed on Surat Art 
Silk (supra) , Commissioner of Income Tax v. Gujarat Maritime Board55 (hereafter 
“Gujarat Maritime Board case ”) and other decisions56. Hence, if the main activity 
is not “business”, the connected, incidental or ancillary activities of sales carried 
out in furtherance of and to accomplish their main objects would not normally, 
amount to business, unless an independent intention  to conduc t ‘business’ in these 
connected, incidental or ancillary activities is established by the revenue. The 
judgments in CST v. Sai Publication Fund57 and the Board of Trustees of the Port 
of Madras (supra)  was relied upon. It was urged that the revenue’s contention that 
statutory authorities’ claim for exemption is confined to the provision in Section

10(46). He urged that in terms of Section 11(7)58 the Board has an option to claim 
exemption either under S ection 11 or under Section 10(46). There is no bar for 
claiming exemption under either of those provisions.  
52. Mr. Dhruv Agrawal, learned senior counsel appearing for the U.P Awas 
Evam Vikas Parishad adopted the submissions of senior counsel Mr. Soparkar 
and K.K Chythyanya. He also urged that the realization of the right to shelter and 
housing is an integral part of right to life, and contended that the predominant 
activity of the assessee involves the fulfilment of those objectives, especially for 
the weak and poorer sections of the society. He relied on this court’s decision in 
Chameli Singh v. State of U.P & Ors.59 which had stated that right to social justice 
includes right to shelter, and that these statutory corporations are the means to 
ensure that.   
53. Mr. K. V. Viswanathan, senior counsel appearing on behalf of GS1 India 
submitted that the assessee is involved in issuing bar codes which is a global 
language of standardised coding and the is a universally accepted standard for 
identification of products. The GS1 barcode is a global standard which is an 
intellectual property of GS1 (an international non -profit organisation 
headquartered at Brussels) and it has affiliates in each country with the assistance 
of national governments. GS1 India the assessee, is an affiliate; it was registered 
as a society in the year 1996, with the Joint Secretary -Ministry of Commerce as 
its President and the ad ministrative control vests with the Ministry of Commerce, 
Government of India. It was registered as a charitable GPU category society in

mandate of the human right to shelter and read it into Article 19(1)(e) and Article 21 of t he Constitution of India 
to guarantee the right to residence and settlement.

1996. All the trade bodies60 as well Bureau of Indian Standards are members of 
its governing council.  
54. It was submitted that the revenue had granted exemptions to the assessee 
society under Section 12A  and Section 10(23C)(iv) while issuing various 
certificates from time to time (from AY 1996 -1997 to 2007 -2008); therefore, it 
had accepted that the assessee’s object  and purpose was charitable, i.e., 
advancement of general public utility. Also, to reflect that there is no 
business/trade/commerce involved and profit motive is absent the learned counsel 
relied upon the decision of the assessee society to issue substanti al discounts to 
the extent of 50% to deserving sectors like cottage industries to enable 
augmentation of market for such sectors , as well as the letter written by CEO -
GS1 to the President GS1 (i.e. Joint Secretary, Ministry of Commerce) to permit 
reduction  of fee from ₹400 too ₹70 per farm/plot, for issuing Global Location 
Number (GLN) to farmers, which was approved.  
55. Regarding the statutory provisions it was submitted that the words “trade, 
commerce or business” in the proviso to Section 2(15) of the IT  Act cannot be 
read in isolation and have to be seen in context of “charitable purpose” and, even 
after a series of amendments - from the Finance Act, 2008 to Finance Act, 2015 
there is essentially, no change in the basis of determination of what amounts t o a 
trade, commerce or business and therefore the tests as laid down in Surat Art Silk  
(supra) still holds the field to interpret these words.  
56. Counsel urged that Parliament is assumed to have used the word ‘involves’ 
found in proviso to Section 2(15) as interpreted in Surat Art Silk (supra) , in the 
sense that an activity is involved in the advancement of an object when it is 
enwrapped or enveloped in the activity of advancement, so that the resulting

activity has a dual nature or is twin faceted. The well -known principle of 
construction, that where the legislature use s in an Act , a legal term which has 
received judicial interpretation, it must be assumed that the term is used in the 
sense in which it h as been judicially interpreted unless a contrary intention 
appears, was relied upon, and the decision in P. Vajravelu Mudaliar v. Special 
Deputy Collector, Madras & Ors .61 was cited in that context.  
57. Countering the contentions of the revenue that if entities making profit but 
not involved in commercial activity desire exemption, they ought to apply under 
Section 10(46) IT Act, it was submitted that the expression “constituted by or 
under an Act” in Section 10(46) does not include all entities like the assessee, 
which is a not a statutory corporation, but a “not for profit” society registered 
under the Societies Act. It was argued that the distinction between “established 
by and under an Act” is well settled and includes entities which are statu tory 
corporations as contrasted from non -statutory ones. The judgment in Dalco 
Engineering Pvt. Ltd. v. Satish Prabhakar Padhye & Ors.62 was referred to, in 
this context where this court ruled that  
“…when the words "by and under an Act" are preceded by the  words 
"established", it is clear that the reference is to a corporation established, 
that it is brought into existence, by an Act or under an Act. In short, the term 
refers to a statutory corporation as contrasted from a non -statutory 
corporation incorpor ated or registered under the Companies Act.”  
58. Learned senior counsel lastly submitted that an activity , to be “trade, 
commerce or business”, must be profit  driven. Profit  motive is a quintessential 
element and an activity without profit motive will not result in “trade, commerce 
or business” in terms of the decision in  State of A.P v. H. Abdul Bakhi & Bros63. 
If exemption is not granted to the assessee it will face a liabi lity of around ₹300

crore (from FY -2007 -08 to 2020 -21), which given its financial condition will 
jeopardise its existence and functioning.  
59. Ms. Radhika Suri, learned counsel argued on behalf of Bhatinda 
Improvement Trust and adopted the submissions of M r. Soparkar. She urged, in 
addition, that it is obligatory on part of the assessee (a statutory corporation) to 
use the monies received for public utility purpose and the price fixation of 
lands/plots sold by them is also regulated through statutory regula tions. 
Therefore, such activities qualify the test of general public utility. Ms. Suri also 
relied on the decision of the Delhi High Court in Greater Noida Industrial 
Development Authority (supra) to the effect that there is need to distinguish 
commercial activity which constitutes disqualification under clause (b) to Section 
10(46) of the Act, and charging and payment of fee, service charges, 
reimbursement of costs or consideration for transfer of rights for performing and 
undertaking regulatory  or administrative duties for general public interest, when 
these are not guided and undertaken with profit motive or intent.  Further, reliance 
was placed on The Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemptions), Chandigarh v. 
M/s Hoshiarpur Improvement Trust, Hoshi arpur64 to explain the characteristics 
of the assessee. Learned counsel further laid emphasis on provisions of the 
regulations under the Punjab Improvement Trust Rules and regulations to show 
the procedure adopted by the board in fixing prices.  
60. Mr. Gur sharan S. Virk, argued that the Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB), is 
a statutory one, constituted under Section 3(2)65 of the Gujarat Maritime Board 
Act, 1981 (GMB Act); it performs functions which, prior to the enactment of the 
Act, were being performed directly by the State Government66. The Preamble to 
the Act notes that it is constituted for administration, control an d management of 
 
64 ITA No. 78 of 2016  
65 Section 3 (2): - “ The board shall be a body corporate by the name aforesaid having perpetual succession and 
a common seal with power, subject to the provisions of this  Act to acquire, hold and dispose of property, both 
movable and immovable, and to contract, and may by th e said name sue and be sued.”   
66 Section 20 of the GMB Act  

minor ports in the State of Gujarat, and for all matters connected therewith. The 
Board’s powers under the GMB Act apply to works carried out by GMB as 
conservator of ports under the provisions of the Indian Ports Act67; it is charged 
with essential functions such as development and upkeep of jetties, wharves, 
docks, piers, places of anchorage, light -houses, light -ships, beacons, buoys, pilot 
boats, and other appliances necessary for safe maritime navigation, etc. and for 
development of mino r ports in general68. It is also entitled to undertake essential 
maritime services such as stevedoring, landing, shipping or trans -shipping, 
piloting, hauling, mooring and hooking vessels/goods, etc .69 Hence it was urged, 
that GMB’s functions are, essentia l and sovereign in nature, and relate to the 
development, safety and protection of the waterfront.  
61. It was submitted that the GMB is not engaged in any business or trade, is 
not engaged in any activity which generat es profit and does not (also statutori ly 
cannot ) use money for anything except for development of minor ports in the 
state of Gujarat and the features of the GMB Act. These features in context of the 
controversy at hand, under the provisions of the IT Act, were considered by this 
court in the Gujarat Maritime Board case (supra) . The decision  discussed 
Sections 73, 74 & 75 of the GMB Act, which provide for management of all 
monies received by the GMB; and Section 76 of the GMB Act, which permits the 
setting aside of surplus money only for “expanding existing facilities or creating 
new facilities at the ports”  or for meeting with contingencies caused on account 
of “fire, cyclones, shipwrecks or other accidents or for any other emergen cy.” It 
was stressed that th at judgment clearly indicates GMB has no profit motive. It 
was therefore, urged that the provisions of the GMB Act, indicate the 
overwhelming public purpose carried out by it without profit motive and that

utilization of funds i s only for the purpose of development, management and 
safety of minor ports; all these entitles GMB to exemption.  
62. Mr. Rohit Jain, learned counsel, appeared on behalf of the Education and 
Research Network (ERNET) and National Internet Exchange of India (NIXI). On 
behalf of ERNET it was submitted that it was started as a planned project of the 
Government of India under the Department of Electronics (DoE) with the support 
of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). The program was focused 
on integrat ing information technology and internet tools with learning 
environment, to enhance the quality of education. However, funding by the 
UNDP ended in 1992. The DoE nevertheless continued to support the project till 
1998 and thereafter the body was registered  as an autonomous society under 
administrative control of the Ministry of Communication and Information 
Technology, Govt. of India on 27.01.1998. It was registered under Section 12A 
of the IT Act, 1961 on 26.03.2004 and its activities fell within the meani ng of 
“charitable purpose” under Section 2(15). It duly complied with Sections 11 and 
12 of the IT Act, 1961.  
63. NIXI was created in 2003 by the Gov ernment  of India under the Ministry 
of Information Technology, for promotion and growth of internet servic es in 
India, regulating the internet traffic and acting as internet exchange, to undertake 
“.in” domain name registration  thereby saving valuable foreign exchange, and 
take care of national concern. It was urged that this is a Section 25 company 
barred fro m undertaking any commercial or business activity for profit and is 
bound by strict licensing conditions, including prohibition on alteration in the 
memorandum of association, without prior consent of the government. The 
“charitable” nature of the same has  also been upheld under Section 12A of the IT 
Act, 1961.  
64. Learned counsel submitted that ERNET is a “not for profit” society 
wherein considering its objects, it receives only subscription fees mainly from 

schools, colleges, universities, scientific res earch institutes, etc. This subscription 
fees is charged on “actual basis” and utilized towards promotion of its objectives. 
The charitable character of the assessee is apparent  and not in dispute since it has 
been accepted by the revenue up to AY 2008 -09. Also, the final factual findings 
recorded by lower authorities conclusively demonstrate that the assessee is 
engaged in ‘advancement of general public utility’, and qualifies a s a ‘charitable 
purpose’ as it does not carry any trade commerce or business, and the income 
earned is not derived in the course of any commercial activity.  
65. Learned counsel also submitted that the assessee carries on R&D work 
which enables educational institutions with Information and Communication 
Technology infrastructure for making education reach the public at large solely 
for charitable purpose and further reliance was placed upon ICAI Accounting 
Research Foundation v. DGIT(E)70, Bureau of Indian S tandards v. DGIT(E)71 
and GS1 India v. DGIT(E)72. 
66. Mr. Ajay Vohra, learned senior counsel, appearing for the Apparel Export 
Promotion Council (AEPC) urged that it is a non -profit organization set up with 
approval of the Central Government, for promotion  of exports of garments from 
India (i.e., promotion of trade). It was registered under Section 12AA(1)  of the 
IT Act, on 18.05.1979 and is engaged in the activity of promotion of the export 
of all kind of ready -made garments, knitwear, and garments made of  leather, jute 
and hemp. It does not per se  engage in any activity for profit, and its mandate is 
to ensure that Indian apparel manufacturers, are given forums and platforms, to 
showcase their products. For that purpose, the AEPC charges subscriptions, and  
provides services, which have general public utility. These activities are by way 
of booking large spaces in fairs, and such like events, especially in overseas 
locales, so that Indian manufacturers can interact with other overseas buyers, and

are enabled  to promote trade. It was submitted that there is ex-officio involvement 
on behalf of the Central Government, in the AEPC’s activities, including in its 
policy formulation levels.  
67. Mr. Vohra relied upon the Memo Explaining Provisions in the Finance 
Bill, 200873, the speech of Finance Minister in Lok Sabha on Finance Bill, 200874, 
CBDT Circular No. 11 dated 19/12/200875 to submit that proviso to Section 2(15) 
only bars commercial/business activities undertaken for profit motive. It was 
submitted that mere earning of income and/or charging any fees is not barred by 
the proviso; rather, carrying of any activity in the natu re of trade, commerce or 
business or rendering service in relation thereto is barred. Reliance was placed 
upon judgments in Dir. Of Supp. & Disp. v. Board of Revenue76 which follows  
H. Abdul Bakhi & Bros (supra) , Barendra  Prasad Ray v. ITO77 and State of 
Gujarat v. Raipur Manufacturing  Co. Ltd.78 to argue that in “business” there must 
be  some real and systematic , or organized course of activity or conduct with the 
set purpose of making profit. Counsel referred to Sai Publication Fund (supra)  
where this court observed that since primary and dominant activity of the trust 
was to spread message of Saibaba and hence not business, then any incidental or 
ancillary activity of publishing and selling of books and literatur e cannot be 
regarded as business. Reference was made to Customs & Excise Commissioner 
v. Lord Fisher79 which held that there are six indicia  to determining business 
namely (a) serious undertaking earnestly pursued, (b) reasonable continuity, (c) 
substantia l in amount, (d) conducted regularly on business principles, (e) 
predominantly concerned with making taxable supplies for consideration, (f) such 
as those commonly made by persons seeking to make profit. Other judgments too

were cited; and reference was ma de to definitions in the Concise Oxford 
Dictionary, Webster’s New Twentieth Century Dictionary, Black’s Law 
Dictionary, and Sampath Iyengar’s Law of Income Tax.  
68. Mr. Ajay Vohra, urged that AEPC  has been claiming exemption under 
Section 11  from AY 1979 -80 to 1990 -91. During AY 1991 -92, the Assessing 
Officer (“AO”) denied the exemption on the ground that it was carrying on 
business. That order was eventually set aside by the ITAT which, held that it was 
entitled to exemption under Section 11  of the Act. Su bsequently, an amendment 
was brought to Section 11(4A)  and AEPC had to maintain separate books of 
accounts. In AY 1992 -93, the AO again denied exemption. On appeal, the issue 
was decided in favour of AEPC by the ITAT. The Delhi High Court upheld the 
order of the ITAT in a judgment80. AEPC received entrance fee and membership 
fee which, it claimed were exempt on the principle of mutuality. This issue too 
was resolved in its favour from the AY 1992 -93 to AY 1997 -98 by the 
jurisdictional High Court. From the a ssessment year 1998 -99 to the assessment 
year 2008 -09, the AO accepted the assessee’s claim that income was exempt 
under Section 11  of the Act.  
69. During AY 2009 -10 and 2010 -11, the AO denied exemption under Section 
11 on the ground that the newly inserted proviso to Section 2(15) was attracted; 
and thus the assessee was ineligible for exemption under Section 11. The AO held 
that the assessee was ren dering services in relation to trade, commerce business 
for consideration and the receipt of which exceeds ₹10 lakhs. The CIT(A) allowed 
the assessee’s appeal following the decision of the High Court in its case, and 
there being no changes in the facts and  circumstances of the case. The ITAT 
upheld the findings of the first appellate authority as it observed that the assessee 
did not carry any activity with an object of profit, and thus the question of 
attracting the proviso did not arise.

70. Ms. Prabha S wami, learned counsel submitted that the A.P State Seed 
Certification Agency  is a statutory society set up under Section 881 of the Seeds 
Act, 1966 which is represented by the representatives of Seedsmen Association, 
seed farmers, farming community and mem bers representing Central Seed 
Certification Board. While explaining the charitable characteristic of the society 
the counsel pointed out that the society was duly registered and its Memorandum 
of Association clearly inter -alia stated that the object for which it was established 
was to see that the cultivators adopt all scientific methods for production of 
quality seeds in accordance with the Seeds Act and to carry on educational 
programs designed to promote the use of certified  seeds. Charges are collected 
from the traders or the societies engaged in the trade of seeds. The society 
provides quality seeds to the farmers and hence traders are prevented from selling 
inferior variety of seeds. Highlighting the activities of the auth ority, it was urged 
that farmers are benefited by various services it offers - inspection of fields at the 
time of seed production, supervision while processing seeds and issuing a 
validation certificate at the time of packing, sampling, and seed testing. The 
society (which is not involved in trade, commerce or business) is therefore 
rendering service to the general public as they are encouraging farmers to 
purchase quality seeds and help prevent loss to them, and loss of natural 
resources. Mr. Sanjay Jhawa r, learned counsel for Rajasthan State Seed 
Corporation also adopted the submissions of Ms. Prabha Swami.  
71. Mr. Sanjay Visen, learned counsel argued on behalf of M/s Raebareli 
Development Authority, Raebareli, urging that the assessee is a body constitut ed 
under the U.P Urban Planning and Development Act, 1973. As their activities 
were aimed at public purpose, it applied for registration u/s 12AA of the IT Act, 
1961. It was submitted that the assessee’s income was earlier exempted under 
 
81 “Section 8. The State Government or the Central Government in consultation with the State Government may, 
by notification in the Official Gazette, establish a certification agency for the State to carry out the functions 
entrusted to the certification agency by or under this Act ”. 

Section 10(20A) of  the IT Act, 1961 which was omitted by the Finance Act, 2002; 
however, this did not restrict the assessee from getting registered under Section  
12AA of IT Act, as the object of the authority is to provide shelter to homeless 
people, which is charitable . 
72. Mr. Harish Salve, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of Saurashtra 
Cricket Association drew attention of this court towards the ambit of Section 4(3) 
of Income Tax Act, 1922 (i.e., the old Act), as compared to Section 2(15)  of the  
IT Act, 1961 which define s ‘charitable purpose’. He also presented the 
construction of Section 11 in light of Thanthi  Trust (supra) . It was emphasized 
that the objects of a trust are decisive and every surplus cannot be construed as 
profit, as is discusse d in Krishna Warri ar (supra). Profits from trade or business 
arising out of property held under trust for charitable purpose, if ploughed back 
to the extent of 100% cannot be termed as a commercial activity. This was the 
principal idea in omitting Section1 3(1)(bb) as it was considered as restrictive for 
carrying out such activities. It was argued that, substitution of the definition of 
“charitable purpose” in Section 2(15) by the Finance Act, 2008 has not changed 
the law. The words “ in relation to any trade , commerce or business ” and “ for a 
cess, fee or consideration ” in the proviso to Section 2(15) implies that 
advancement of object of  a trust may not involve activities of profit. It was urged 
that the amendment appears to have undermined this court’s deci sion in Surat Art 
Silk (supra).  
73.  It was argued that the crucial part of the definition of “charitable purpose” 
is the word “cess” employed in the proviso. As an explanatory measure, the 
activities of promotional councils were taken into consideration - for example 
Surat Art Silk  supported silk manufacturers. If such activity is for a cess or a fee, 
the organization ceases to be charitable. Activities  in the nature  of trade,  
commerce  or business  are not charitable  if they are for a fee or other  
consider ation.  Fees collected by the private  organizations forms the content of 
Section 2(15). However, amounts based on tariff regulations imposed by the 

controlling law, or statute -based fee is neither “fee” nor “cess” under that 
provision. Further, the consider ation involved is vis-à-vis the activity or service. 
The test is the object  for which the consideration is paid, and what it entails, 
wherein the words “any other consideration” is for the activities in aid or service 
of business. In this regard it was submitted that, in true sense the word “business” 
implies profit, however statutory  organizations are excluded from its ambit. Fee 
or consideration collected by such organizations should not be taken in the sense 
of profiteering, as it is for the advancement of their objectives. In this sense the 
word “cess” can be read down as non -statutory.  
74. It was submitted that the phrase “cess, fee or any other consideration” in 
the  proviso to Section 2(15) covers the second part of the proviso, i.e. , it is 
relatable to “service in relation to” trade, commerce or business. Mr. Salve 
submitt ed that any statutory cess, or fee, authorized or compelled by law, which 
is within the domain of the state legislature, cannot be construed as taxable, 
having regard to the principles indicated in the judgment of this court, in NDMC 
(supra) . He relied on Article 289 of the Constitution of India, and submitted that 
it is only if a state engages – by itself, or through an agency, directly in trading 
activity, that the immunity from Union taxation is lifted. In the present case, those 
agencies set up by the State, essentially through law, to carry out welfare 
activities, such as regulation and housing, cannot per se be characterized as 
trading concerns.  
75. Mr. Salve submitted that cricket associations are operating purely to 
advance their objective of promot ing the sport. They should not be considered as 
pursing activities in furtherance of trade, commerce or business. The word “cess” 
has to be read down in reverse (reverse ejusdem generis)  and it should be read 
non-statutorily  while adopting purposive interpretation of the same. Reliance was 

placed on Nabha Power Limited v. Punjab SPCL82 to state that a purposive 
interpretation of “cess”, is to be adopted.  
76. It was also argued that the sport of cricket is a form of education and if it 
is not considered as a field of education, it is still an object of general public 
utility. The primary regulating body i.e., the BCCI, promotes sport in the entire 
country and worldwide, and the assessees herein are its second and third tier 
associations.  The revenue generated by BCCI flows to state and regional cricket 
associations in the form of grants to maintain stadia, conduct matches, organize 
training camps, and other ancillary purposes. Counsel relied on the objects 
of Saurashtra Cricket Association which inter alia include, the control, 
supervision, regulation, encouragement, promotion and development of the game 
of cricket in the Association’s jurisdiction.  Other objects include creation, 
fostering friendly relationships through sports tournaments and the creation of a 
healthy sportsmanship spirit, through the medium of sports in general and cricket 
in particular. All other objects were similar, including “to arrange, and/or 
manage among other things league and/or any other tournaments” ; organize 
matches, lay out grounds for playing cricket, organization of matches in aid of 
public charities, etc. If these associations sell tickets and generate revenue 
through  other activities, those do not necessarily mean that their objects are 
commerc ial or to promote trade. Selling tickets for a sport  performance or match  
is to promote cricket, and not trade . Mr. Salve also urged that the expression 
“trade” has a particular  meaning; he referred to State of Gujarat v. Maheshkumar 
Dhirajal Thakkar83 where the court observed that  
“the word trade in its narrow popular sense means ‘exchange of goods for 
goods or for money with the object of making profit’. In its widest sense it  
includes any business carried on with a view to earn profit84. Further, the 
word takes its meaning from the context.”

77. Likewise, with regard to “business” the counsel referred to H. Abdul Bakhi 
& Bros . (supra) which had discussed the term and explained that any activity 
should be driven by profit motive.85 Lastly, the judgment in Secretary, Ministry 
of Education & Broadcasting, Govt. of India & Ors. v. Cricket Association of 
Bengal86 was cited to explai n the dominant purpose of the BCCI. That judgment 
highlighted what is relevant and applicable is the test of predominant character of 
the activity, and not that an institution incidentally earns surplus or profit.  
78. Mr. Arvind Datar , learned senior counsel appeared on behalf of the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (hereafter “ICAI”) as well as The 
Tribune Trust.  
79. Counsel submitted that ICAI is a premier professional accountancy body 
of the country established under the  Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 (“CA Act”) 
to impart formal and quality education in accounting and thereafter to regulate 
the profession of Chartered Accountancy in India. It is under the control and 
supervision of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Gove rnment of India. Section 
1587 of the CA Act defines the functions of Council of Institute which include 
 
85 “the expression ‘business’ though extensively used is a word of indefinite import, in taxing statutes it is used in 
the sense of an occupation, or profession which occupies the time, attention and labour  of a person, normally with 
the object of making profit. To regard an activity as business there must be a course of dealings, either actually 
continued or contemplated to be continued with a profit motive, and not for sport or pleasure. But to be a dealer  
a person need not follow the activity of buying, selling and supplying the same commodity. Mere buying for 
personal consumption i.e. without a profit motive will not make a person a dealer within the meaning of the Act, 
but a person who consumes a commodi ty bought by him in the course of his trade, or use in manufacturing another 
commodity for sale, would be regarded as a dealer” . 
87 15. Functions of Council  (1) The Institute shall function under the overall control, guidance and supervis ion 
of the Council and the duty of carrying out the provisions of this Act shall be vested in the Council.  
(2) In particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing powers, the duties of the Council shall 
include – 
(a) to approve academic courses and their contents;  
 (b) the examination of candidates for enrolment and the prescribing of fees therefor;  
 (c) the regulation of the engagement and training of articled and audit assistants;  
 (d) the prescribing of qualifications for entr y in the Register;  
 (e) the recognition of foreign qualifications and training for the purposes of enrolment;  
 (f) the granting or refusal of certificates of practice under this Act;  
(g) the maintenance and publication of a Register of persons qualified t o practice as chartered accountants;  
 (h) the levy and collection of fees from members, examinees and other persons;  
 (i) subject to the orders of the appropriate authorities under the Act, the removal of names from the Register and 
the restoration to the Register of names which have been removed;

holding of examinations for chartered accountancy course candidates and 
regulation of engagement and training of articled clerks and audit assistants.  
80. It was submitted that holding of coaching and revision classes, and surplus 
generated due to the fees collected from that activity is not a business or 
commercial activity. Counsel urged that it is wholly incidental and ancillary to 
the objects of the i nstitute - which is to provide education and conduct 
examinations of the candidates enrolled for chartered accountancy courses, so as 
to bring out true professionalism. Therefore, separate books of accounts are not 
required to be maintained in terms of Sec tion 11(4A) read with the fifth and 
seventh proviso to Section 10(23C) of IT Act, 1961. It was urged that ICAI was 
not hit by the proviso to S ection  2(15) of the IT Act (inserted w.e.f. 01.04.2009) 
since its activities fall within the purview of the clause  “education” specified in 
the definition of the expression “charitable purpose” in S. 2(15) of the said Act, 
and not the residuary clause relating to the GPU category, wherein the proviso 
solely applies to the latter. In this regard the counsel referred to  the Gujarat High 
Court judgment in Saurashtra Education Foundation v. CIT88 which took into 
account the observations made in another judgment by the same High Court in 
Gujarat State Co -operative Union v. CIT89, to hold that the ICAI was existing 
solely fo r educational purposes and its activities clearly fall within the category 
of ‘education’ in S ection  2(15) of the Act. In further support of this proposition, 
reliance was placed on American Hotel and Lodging Association v. CBDT90 to 
 
 (j) the regulation and maintenance of the status and standard of professional qualifications of members of the 
Institute;  
(k) the carrying out, by granting financial assistance to persons other than members of th e Council or in any other 
manner, of research in accountancy;  
 (l) the maintenance of a library and publication of books and periodicals relating to accountancy;  
 (m) to enable functioning of the Director (Discipline), the Board of Discipline, the Discipli nary Committee and 
the Appellate Authority constituted under the provisions of this Act;  
 (n) to enable functioning of the Quality Review Board;  
 (o) consideration of the recommendations of the Quality Review Board made under clause (a) of Section 28B and 
the details of action taken thereon in its annual report; and  
 (p) to ensure the functioning of the Institute in accordance with the provisions of this Act and in performance of 
other statutory duties as may be entrusted to the Institute from time to time.

argue that ICAI is entitled to be notified under Section 10(23C)(iv) r/w Section 
2(15) of the Act, 1961.  
81. Counsel submitted that profit motive is an essential element, or the driving 
force, for any business or commercial activity. The activities of ICAI are not of 
such na ture. Counsel relied upon the judgment in NDMC  (supra)  which ruled that 
profit motive is the core aspect of trade and business, in the context of Article 289 
of the Constitution of India, which talks about exemption of property and income 
of a state from U nion Taxation.  
82. It was argued that there is a distinction between nature of commercial 
ventures and charitable institutions such as ICAI. The word ‘profit’ should never 
be used with a  body set up for public purposes, to regulate activities, in public 
interest and the intent of the organization/establishment must be taken into 
consideration. In support, Board of Trustees of the Port of Madras (supra) was 
cited,  where the Port trust’s activities included sale of unclaimed and 
unserviceable goods in discha rge of various statutory charges, items, etc. They 
were part of the Port Trust’s main activities of service. The court said that they 
cannot be treated as ‘business’ and that the Port Trust had no intention to carry 
on business in the sale of unserviceable /unclaimed goods. Reliance was placed 
on Surat Art Silk (supra), Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation 
(supra) , Victoria Technical Institute v CIT91, Aditnar Educational Institution v. 
Addl. CIT92, Thiagarajar Charities v. ACIT93, Director of Income Tax v. Bharat 
Diamond Bourse94 and Gujarat Maritime Board  case (supra) . The observations 
in T.M.A Pai (supra)  that there can be reasonable revenue surplus, by the 
educational institution for the purpose of development of education and 
expansion of the institution, was also referred to.

83. Learned senior counsel further relied on  the explanatory notes to the 
provisions of the Finance Act, 2008, specifically towards amendment made to 
Section 2(15) of the IT Act, aimed at streamlining the d efinition of “charitable 
purpose” as discussed in para 595 and the ratio  Visvesvarya Technological 
University v. Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax96 to submit that there is no 
loss to the character of a GPU charity where surplus generated is ploughed back. 
Further, a judgment of the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court in J.K 
Synthetics & Another v. Union of India & Ors.97 was referred to contend th at it is 
not open for the revenue authorities, without any cogent reason and merely at its 
own caprices, to refuse to follow the conclusion reached on the earlier occasion, 
and to take up a totally different stand in subsequent years - as was done in this 
case while refusing to grant exemption under Section 10 (23C) of IT Act, 1961 
to the ICAI.  
84. Learned counsel further submitted that the present case involves two 
circulars issued by the Board viz. Circular No. 1/2009 dated 27.03.2009 and 
Circular No. 11 /2008 dated 19.12.2008 which are clarificatory and not contrary 
to any provisions of the Act, 1961 and hence the ratio  of the decision in Ratan 
Melting and Wire Industries  (supra)  does not apply. Reliance was placed on 
observations made in Navnit Lal Zaver i (supra)  and Ellerman Lines v. 
 
95 "5. Streamlining the definition of “charitable purpose”    
5.1 Sub -section (15) of section 2 of the Act defines “charitable purpose” to include relief of the poor, education, 
medical relief, and the advancement of any other object of general public utility. This is based on the argument 
that they are engaged in the “advancement of an obj ect of general public utility” as is included in the fourth limb 
of the current 12 It has been noticed that a number of entities operating   on commercial lines are claiming 
exemption on their income either under sub -section   
(23C) of section 10 or section 11 of the Act on the ground that they are charitable  institutions. This  is based on 
the argument that they are engaged in the “advancement of an object of general public utility” as is included in 
the fourth limb of the current  definition of “chari table purpose”. Such a claim, when made in respect of an activity 
carried out on commercial lines, is contrary to the intention of the provision.   
5.2 With a view to limiting the scope of the phrase “advancement of any other   object of general public utili ty”, 
sub-section (15) of section 2 has been amended to   provide that the advancement of any other object of general 
public utility shall not be   
a charitable purpose, if it involves the carrying on of any activity in the nature of   trade, commerce or busin ess, 
or any activity of rendering any service in relation to   any trade, commerce or business, for a cess or fee or any 
other consideration,   irrespective of the nature of use or application, or retention, of the income from 
such activity.”

Commissioner of Income Tax98 to urge that these circulars are classified as 
“beneficial”. They place a purposive interpretation on a statutory provision. Such 
circulars enormously reduce litigation and hardship of assessees and they play a 
vital role in the proper administration of taxes.  
85. It was argued that the demand against ICAI is from 2004 -05 and the fees 
collected from students have already been spent on various infrastructure 
development and other capital expenditur e items. The surplus amounts remaining 
were invested in government securities/FDs of nationalized banks, so the 
demands raised will seriously prejudice the assessees.  
86. On behalf of the Tribune Trust, Mr. Datar  argued that the charitable nature 
of the trust can be traced back to the In Re: Trustees of the Tribune  (supra) 
judgment rendered by the Privy Council, which allowed the trust’s appeal against 
the judgment of Lahore High Court (that rejected exemption for  the trust’s 
income for AY 1932 -33). The Privy Council considered the objects of the trust 
and held it was not founded for private profit and prima facie  the trust’s object 
was of general public utility, since by supplying newspapers in the province the 
trust involved the dissemination of educated public opinion. It was urged that the 
impugned judgment passed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court99 in Tribune’s 
case dismissing the Tribune’s appeal, erroneously relied on para 17 of Surat Art 
Silk decision (su pra) which wrongly quoted the Privy council judgment in the 
Tribune’s case.   
87. It was further argued that collecting advertisements for consideration 
cannot be treated as business activity undertaken by profit because the sale price 
of the newspaper is ₹2 whereas the cost of printing each newspaper is ₹12 and 
the deficits can be made up only through advertisements. Placing reliance on the 
extracts from the will of the late Sardar Dyal Singh Majithia it was urged that the 
 
99 ITA Nos. 62 of 2015 and 147 of 2016 (O&M)

98 (1972) 4 SCC 474

trustees were under a duty to dev ote the surplus income for the improvement of 
the newspaper and hence prayed for allowing the appeal.  
88. Upon this court’s query with respect to advancing submissions on the 
constitutional aspect in the ITPO judgment  (supra) , the learned senior counsel 
advanced his submissions on the validity of Section  2(15) in the context of 
Article 14 and Article 289.  It was submitted that classification made in the ITPO 
judgment i.e., institutions driven by profit motive vis-à-vis institutions driven by 
motive to advance objective of GPU, was correct and is in tune with the decision 
of this court in NDMC  (supra). It was urged that Article 289(1) will not apply to 
ITPO as its income and property cannot be regarded as income and property of a 
State. It was also submitted that proviso to Section 2(15) applies only to the last 
limb i.e., “advancement of object of general public utility”  and not to the 
preceding limb “education”  and in respect of charity there is no discernible 
difference between the two. Since there is no intelligible differentia and rational 
nexus in this regard, this discrimination offends Article 14.  
89. It was argued  that the term “for a cess or fee or any other consideration”  
used in Section 2(15) is clearly violative of Article 14 as it fails to make a 
distinction between activities that are carried out by the State or by the 
instrumentalities or agencies of the State, and those carried out by commercial 
entities for which a consideration is charged. In addition, Art icle 289(1) exempts 
states’ property and income from Union taxation. To permit levy of income tax 
on cess or fee collected by a state would violate Art icle 289(1), hence the word 
“cess” or “fee” in the proviso is liable to be declared unconstitutional and 
violative not only of Article 14 but of Article 289 as well, in the context of state 
undertakings. For Central institutions, it was submitted that cess o r fee can never 
fall within the definition of “income” under Section 2(24) read with Entry 82 of 
List-I and cannot be subject to tax.  
 

C. Revenue’s rebuttal arguments  
90. In rebuttal to the submissions advanced by the assessees , the ASG relied 
upon Adityapur  Industrial Area Development Authority v. Union of India100 and 
submitted that there is no constitutional immunity from taxation, for the state, 
because by Article 289(2) even state or its instrumentalities/agencies are not 
immune from taxation if they carry on trade or business. In light of Art icle 289(2), 
there is no constitutional bar for the States (or the Union) to engage or carry on 
trade or business, and Article 289 allows the Parliament to impose taxes on such 
trade or business. The ratio  in NDMC  (supra)  has to be read in light of the 
provisions and the judgment rendered in Shri Ra mtanu Coop erative  Housing 
Society (supra)  should in turn be read in light of NDMC. The decisive factor 
therefore is not the status of the entity, but the nature of activity carried by it. If 
the nature of activity is trade or business with a profit motive, then the same can 
be taxed even if it is carried by state or its instrumentalities. It was also contended 
that Article 289 does not grant absolute any immunity fro m taxation.  
91. The revenue further submitted that the validity of the amendment can be 
tested especially in the case of exclusions or exemptions on limited grounds - 
invalidity, arbitrariness, unreasonableness, discrimination; and the assessees have 
not m ade out a case under any such ground. Also, by referring to In Re: Trustees 
of the Tribune and All India Spinners Association  of Mirzapur  (supra), it was 
contended that “general public utility” is only a statutory creation so as to form 
part of charitable purposes and it can always be given a statutory import by 
subjecting it to conditions and limitations prescribed under Section 2(15), at 
different points of time. In other words, it can always be regulated or modulated 
through statutory prescrip tions, conditions , and limitations while granting an 
exemption from taxation. The submission of the assessees , that one has to look 
only at the objects to determine if it constitute s charitable purpose for Section

100 (2006) 5 SCC 100

2(15) of the Act, is to be rejected becaus e exemptions or exclusions are not based 
on mere objects of trust but on whether the purpose of the trust is “ advancement 
of any other object of general public utility ”. 
 
III. Analysis and reasoning  
92. The history of the statute and the evolving interpretation of “charitable 
purpose ” reveals that in - P. Krishna Warriar  (supra) , this court extensively 
considered the previous jurisprudence on the subject  (in light of the pre -existing 
Section 4(3) of the old law ), as well as the amendment introduced in 1953 . At 
that time,  income  of a charitable organization,  earned from business  was subject 
to limitations. The limitations were that (i) the business was to be carried on in 
the course of the actual carrying out of a primary purpose of the trust or 
institution ; or (ii) the work in connection with the business was to be mainly 
carried on by beneficiaries of the institution.  These expressions were considered 
in Krishna Warri ar (supra) , where the court held that the term “property” (of a 
trust) was of widest amplitude, which included business. The following decision, 
in Andhra Chamber  of Commerce  (supra) where the chamber of commerce had 
among its objects, one enabling it to advocate policies or legislation, or op pose 
them, in addition to the object of promoting business, held that the incidental 
inclusion of such objects, involving  espousing a political purpose, did not 
undermine its essential or main purpose, of advancing objects of general public 
utility.  The new provision, i.e. , Section 2(15) of the IT Act, defined “charitable 
purpose” restrictively : to deny tax exemption to activities for profit  which were 
carried on by a trust for the advancement of an object of general public utility.  
The reason for this change (discussed previously) was that the advantage of tax 
exemption was not intended  to charitable trusts that were commercial concerns, 
which while ostensibly serving a public purpose, were fully paid for the benefits 
provided by them.  

93. The first two decisions of some note  are Lok Shikshana Trust  and Indian 
Chamber of Commerce  (supra) . The former decision, by majority, held that to 
qualify as a charitable purpose, two ingredients had to be satisfied. It was held 
that the change in the definition meant that to be the fourth category of charitable 
purpose, it was necessary to show that   
“(1) the purpose of the trust is the advancement of any other object of general 
public utility, and (2) the above purpose does not involve the carrying on of 
any activity for profit. Both the above conditions must be fulfilled before the 
purpose of the trust  can be held to be charitable purpose.”  
 
94. In Indian Chamber  of Commerce  this court categorically held that even if 
the activity for profit, is to further an object of general public utility, the charity 
could not claim  of exemption. The court went on to indicate the following test:  
“21. The true test is to ask for answers to t he following questions: (a) Is the 
object of the assessee one of general public utility? (b) Does the advancement 
of the object involve activities bringing in moneys? (c) If so, are such 
activities undertaken (i) for profit or (ii) without profit? Even if (a) and (b) 
are answered affirmatively, if (c)(i) is answered affirmatively, the claim for 
exemption collapses. The solution to the problem of an activity being 
one for or irrespective of profit is gathered on a footing of facts. What is the 
real nature of  the activity? One which is ordinarily carried on by ordinary 
people for gain? Is there a built -in prescription in the constitution against 
making a profit?....”   
 
95. The decision in Surat Art  Silk, needs careful scrutiny, not only because it 
is by a larger Bench, but also because it has been the bulwark of the assessee’s 
contentions - and has been the premise upon which almost all High Courts have 
interpreted Section 2 (15) after its amendment, in 200 8. As noticed earlier, the 
old Act  (in Section 4(3))  did not contain any terms, restricting or prohibiting 
charities from engaging in commercial activities or those which yielded profit. 
No doubt, the idea of income from business carried on  “behalf of a religious or 
charitable institution” being exempt, provided “the business is carried on in the 
course of the actual carrying out of a primary purpose of the institution” was 
introduced by amendment, in 1953. This was interpreted in Andhra Cham ber of 
Commerce  and Krishna Warri ar (supra) . However, Parliament clearly intended a 

departure, when it introduced the new Section 2 (15) under the IT Act. The earlier 
decisions in Indian Chamber of Commerce, and Lok Shikshana Trust  (supra) 
noticed this cha nge. Surat Art (supra) was yet another a departure. While it  
considered the previous decisions of the court , it consciously departed from them, 
and even overruled the interpretation in Indian Chamber of Commerce (supra). 
The larger Bench in Surat Art  Silk agreed with the previous decisions to the effect 
that the motivation for the activity in question ( i.e., for it to be charitable) should 
not be deriving of profits. However,  the larger Bench enunciated the principle of 
‘predominant object’ and held that what was of importance was “ whether the 
predominant object of the activity involved in carrying out the object  of general 
public utility is to subserve the charitable purpose or to earn profit” and that such 
an entity would not lose its charitable character merely because some profit arose 
from the said activity.  
96. Thus,  was born the ‘predominant object ’ test, of an organization, to 
determine whether it was essentially charitable, or ‘for profit ’. If the predominant 
object was not for profit,  but advancement of general public utility, that some 
profits were earned, would not debar it from claiming to be a n organization with 
a charitable purpose. However, if the predominant object was such that profit 
making was “enwrapped ” or “intertwined ” with it, the organization or trust could 
not be called charitable. Crucially, the court emphasized that the manner of 
carrying on of the activity in question,  was determinative:  
“the nature of the charitable purpose, the manner in which the activity for 
advancing the charitable purpose is being carried on and the surrounding 
circumstances may clearly indicate that the activity is not propelled by a 
dominant profit motive.”  
97. Interestingly, the test proposed by the majority judgment in Surat Art  Silk 
is similar to the one advocated in Indian Chamber of Commerce (which it 
overruled). The difference in approach is that Surat Art  Silk advocated the 
“predominant object” test to see whether the object is for advanceme nt of general 
public utility, bereft  of profit motive, whereas in Indian Chamber of Commerce  

(supra) , the court did not deal with or visualize consideration of a “predominant 
object”. The second difference between the two decisions, is that Surat Art  Silk 
stated that there is no need for an express provision in the constitution of a given 
trust, eschewing  profit motive, whereas in Indian Chamber of Commerce, the 
necessity of such a condition was highlighted.  
98. The judgments of this court, after Surat Art Silk  (supra),  noticed the 
enunciation of, and the need to apply the test of “dominant” object . In 
Commissioner of Income Tax v . Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce 
and Industries101 it was, thus held:   
“In other words, the majority view in the Surat Art Silk's case (supra) was that 
the condition that the purpose should not involve the carrying on of any activity 
for profit would be satisfied if profit -making is not the real object. The theory 
of dominant or primary object of the trust has, therefore, been treated to be 
the determining factor, even in regard to the fourth head of charity , viz., the 
advancement of any other object of general public utility, so as to make the 
carrying on of business activity merely ancillary or incidental to the main 
object.”  
 
99. In Bar Council of Maharashtra  (supra)  this court considered whether a bar 
council, constituted under the Advocates Act , 1961 , performed activities that 
were charitable in nature; it was held that the statute obliged several activities 
whose dominant object was advancement of public utility, without profit motive. 
This court held that the provisions of the Act  
“enjoined upon avowedly with the objective of protecting the litigating public 
from unscrupulous professionals by taking them to task for any misconduct 
on their part; it is also one of the obligatory functions of a State Bar Council 
to promote and support measures for law reform as also to conduct law 
seminars and organise talks on legal topics by eminent jurists, obviously with 
a view to educate the general public, the function prescrib ed by Clause (eee) 
is obviously charitable in nature, the same being to organise legal aid to the 
poor. Amongst these various obligatory functions one under Clause (d) is to 
safeguard the rights, privileges and interests of the advocates on its roll and 
it is difficult to regard it as a primary or dominant function or purpose for 
which the body is constituted. Even this function apart from securing speedy 
discharge of obligations by the litigants to the lawyers ensures maintenance 
of high professional stand ards and independence of the Bar which are 
 
101 1981  (3) SCR  489 

necessary in the performance of their duties to the society. In other words, the 
dominant purpose of a State Bar Council as reflected by the various 
obligatory functions is to ensure quality service of competent l awyers to the 
litigating public, to spread legal literacy, promote law reforms and provide 
legal assistance to the poor while the benefit accruing to the lawyer -members 
is incidental …” 
 
100. The view that prevailed, after the decision in Surat Art Silk (supra), 
therefore, was that so long as the “dominant” object of a trust was charitable, and 
it did not essentially involve in business or commercial activity, the generation of 
profits, or surpluses by it, through activities, incidental to that main or do minant 
activity, did not undermine its charitable purpose, as long as the surpluses or 
profits, were used for the advancement of an object of general public utility.   
101. An interesting detail, is that the old Act  did not define “charitable purpose”  
restrictively, in the manner that the IT Act did, when enacted, in 1961. This lent 
a fair degree of interpretive flexibility, to the courts, to decide whether a 
commercial or business element, could be interwoven with a charitable object. 
The amendment of 1953 ensured that income “applied or accumulated for 
application to such .. charitable purposes as relate to anything done within the 
taxable territories, and in the case of property so held in part only for such 
purposes, the income applied or finally set apar t for application …”102 could not 
be included  as taxable income of any charitable organization. This provision is a 
precursor for Section 11 under the IT Act.  In other words, the structure of the old 
Act did not prohibit the carrying on of business; it spelt out a condition that any 
income derived from business “carried on in the course of the actual carrying 
out of a primary purpose of the institution” if applied for charitable purposes , 
was exempt.  
102. The second aspect is that  Surat Art Silk  (supra) , was rendered in the context 
of Section 2(15) of the IT Act, as it stood originally. However, by the Taxation 
Laws Amendment Act, 1975 (w.e.f. 01 .04.1977), Section 13(1)(bb) was inserted. 
 
102 Section 4(3)(i) of the old IT Act.  

That provision excluded the operation of Sections 11 and 12 (under which income 
of charities were entitled to be exempted)  in the case of income derived from 
business  by charities engaged in medical relief, education and relief to the poor, 
unless  the business fulfilled a condition:  
“(bb) in the cases of a charitable trust or institution for the relief of the 
poor, education or medical relief, which carries on any business, any 
income derived from such business, unless the business is carried on in  the 
course of the actual carrying out of a primary purpose of the trust or 
institution;"   
 
103. The interpretation in Surat Art Silk  (supra) , obviously could not have been 
affected, in the light of a subsequent amendment; however, what is of significance 
is that with effect from 01.04.1977 , the condition of actual carrying on a primary 
purpose of the trust while conducting business  was visualised only in the case of 
trusts involved in relief of the poor, education or medical relief . The majority 
judgment in Surat Art Silk  (supra)  recognized this:  
“8. […] Where therefore, there is a charitable trust or institution falling 
within any of the first three categories of charitable purpose set out in Section 
2 Clause (15) and it carries on business which is held by it under trust for its 
charitable purpose, incom e from such business would not be exempt by 
reason of Section 13(1)(bb). Section 11 Sub -section (4) would, therefore, have 
no application in case of a charitable trust or institution falling within any of 
the first three heads of 'charitable purpose'.”  
 
Yet, the court enunciated and applied the ‘predominant object ’ test.103 The 
conscious omission of the last object , i.e., the  GPU  category , in the newly inserted 
13(1)(bb), therefore, meant that when  those trusts, while carrying out the object 
of advancement of general public utility, had to conduct of business, the income 
was to be taxed (because the main provision, under Section 13(1) excluded the 
operation of Sections 11 and 12).  
104. The next sign ificant change, which occurred was with the Finance Act, 
 
103 See para 19 of Surat Art Silk (extracted above at paragraph 18 of this judgment).  

Citations:
1983 (w.e.f . 01.04.1984 ). This amendment:

(a) omitted the restrictive words under Section 2(15)  i.e. “not  involving 
the carrying on of any activity for profit”   
(b) omitted Section 13(1)(bb)  
(c) Section 11(4A) was inserted104, by which  - in relation to charities set up 
with the object of general public utilities , “business”  could be “ carried on 
by an institution wholly for charitable purposes and the work in connection 
with the busine ss is mainly carried on by the beneficiaries of the institution, 
and separate books of account are maintained by the trust or institution in 
respect of such business ”. 
105. It is th erefore  clear that after 1 April, 1984, the statute did not contain any 
restriction as to the nature of activity that could be carried on by GPU category 
charity . Furthermore, the condition in Section 13(1)(bb) - which applied to other 
kinds of trusts , i.e., that their incomes could be exempt under Section 11 to the 
extent they arose out of business, if the business was “ in the course of the actual 
carrying out of a primary purpose of the trust” - was deleted . On the other hand, 
the wording of Section 11(4A) did seem to indicate that business activity was 
permissible if the objects of the trust were wholly charitable, and such business 
were to be carried on by its beneficiaries.  This legal position continued, till the 
amendments in question were carried out, in relation to Section 2(15) in 2008.  
106. Section 2 begins with the expression “ unless the context otherwise 
requires ”- as a preface to every expression which is sought to be defined, under 
the IT Act. The 1922 Act did not contain any words of restriction, in the definition  
 
104 "(4A) Sub -section (1) or sub -section (2) or sub -section (3) or sub -section (3A) shall not apply in relation to 
any income, being profits and gains of business, unless – 
(a) the business is carried on by a trust wholly for public religious purposes and the business consists of 
printing and publication of books or publication of books or is of a kind notified by the Central Government in 
this behalf in the Official Gazette; or  
(b) the business  is carried on by an institution wholly for charitable purposes and the work in connection with 
the business is mainly carried on by the beneficiaries of the institution, and separate books of account are 
maintained by the trust or institution in respect o f such business. …"  
 

clause. The IT Act, however, define d charitable purpose  - at the outset, 
restrictively , and then, substantively enact ed provisions that give effect to 
Parliamentary intent. Section 10 (23 C)(iv) exempts  any “income” of  “any other 
fund or institution established for charitable purposes which may be approved by 
the prescribed authority, having regard to the objects of the fun d or institution 
and its importance throughout  India or throughout any State or States” from 
taxation.  
 
A. Aids to interpretation  
(i) History of the legislation  
107. The amendments (i.e. Finance Act  2008 , Finance Act  2009, Finance Act 
2012 and Finance Act 2015) do not throw light – by way of statement of objects 
and reasons or notes on clauses . The court, therefore would have to resort to the 
surrounding circumstances that led to the amendment.  
108. The words of a statute are to be construed in their terms, according to the 
circumstances in which they occur. A t the same time, there is some aut hority for 
the proposition that statutes – particularly amending provisions, may be 
considered in the light of the previous history of the legislation. Justice Cardozo  
in Duparquet Co. v. Evans105 said that  in questions relating to construction,  
"history is a teacher that is not to be ignored ”. In a similar vein, Chief Judge 
Learned Hand said that “statutes always have some purpose or object to 
accomplish, whose sympathetic and imaginative discovery is the surest guide to 
their meaning ”106. 
109. Some decisions of this Court have highlighted this aspect.  In Bhuwalka 
Steel Indus. Ltd. & Ors. v . Bombay Iron and Steel Labour Bd. & Ors . 107 this court 
observed that  
 
105 297 U.S. 216 (1936)  
106 Cabell v. Markham  (1945) 148 F 2d 737  
107  2009 (16) SCR 618  

“The legislative intent of the enactment may be gathered from several sources 
which are, from the statute itself, from the preamble to the statute, from the 
Statement of Objects and Reasons, from the legislative debates, reports of 
committees and commissions which preceded the legislation and finally from 
all legitimate and admissible sou rces from where they may be allowed. 
Reference may be had to legislative history and latest legislation also. But, 
the primary rule of construction would be to ascertain the plain language 
used in the enactment which advances the purpose and object of the 
legislation...”  
 
110. In Chief Justice of Andhra Pradesh & Ors. v . L.V.A. Dixitulu & Ors .108 
again, the court held that resort to the history of the legislation is legitimate, for 
interpreting a provision :  
“..in order to ascertain the true meaning of the terms and phrases employed, 
it is legitimate for the Court to go beyond the arid literal confines of the 
provision and to call in aid other well -recognised rules of construction, such 
as its legislative history, the basic scheme and framework of the statute as a 
whole, each portion throwing light on the rest, the purpose of the legisla tion, 
the object sought to be achieved, and the consequences that may flow from 
the adoption of one in preference to the other possible interpretation.”  
 
111. Other decisions109 have also commented on the use of history of the 
legislation as a tool for its construction.  It is, therefore, clear that courts can look 
at the previous history  of the statute , and the changes it underwent  to discern what 
is intended by the lawmakers whe n an amendment is introduced , or a new law 
enacted. In light of these factors, it would therefore , also be useful for the court 
to consider the background which led to the amendment – firstly in 2008 and 
thereafter in 2012 and 2015, seeking to restrict the  nature of activities that a GPU 
category charity can legitimately undertake.  
 
(ii) Other extrinsic aids to construction of the statute  
(a) Speeches in Parliament  
112. Speeches made in the legislature or Parliament, can be looked into for 
throwing light on the rationale for an amendment. There is some authority for 
 
108 1979 (1) SCR  26 
109 Lohia Machines Ltd. and Ors. v. Union of India & Ors  1985 (2) SCR 686; Commissioner of Customs (Import), 
Mumbai v. Dilip Kumar & Company & Ors 2018 (9) SCC 1  

that proposition.110 Some light can be discerned from the statement of the finance 
minister  on the floor of Parliament, who answered to the criticism levelled against 
the change brought about by the amendment in 2008. The finance minister  
comment ed on the criticism levelled against the  amendment to Section 2(15) in 
the following words:  
"I once again assure the House that genuine charitable organisations will 
not in any way be  affected. The CBDT will, following the usual practice, 
issue an explanatory circular containing  guidelines for determining 
whether an entity is carrying on any activity in the nature of  trade,  
commerce or business or any activity of rendering any service in relation 
to any trade, commerce or  business. Whether the purpose is a charitable 
purpose will depend on the totality of the facts of the  case. Ordinarily, 
Chambers of Commerce and sim ilar organisations rendering services to 
their  members would not be affected by the amendment and their activities 
would continue to be  regarded as "advancement of any other object of 
general public utility".”  
 
(b) Departmental circulars  
113. Learned counsel for the assesse es relied upon Circular No. 1 /2009 dated 
27.03.2009 and Circular No.  11/2008 dated 19.12.2008  issued by the Central 
Board of Direct Taxes . The relevant part of Circular No. 11/2008 reads as 
follows:  
“3. The newly inserted proviso to section 2(15) will apply only to entities 
whose purpose  is ‘advancement of any other object of general public utility’ 
i.e. the fourth limb of the definition  of ‘charitable purpose’ contained in 
section 2(15). Hence, such entities will not be el igible for exemption under 
section 11 or under  section 10(23C) of the Act if they carry on commercial 
 
110 State of West Bengal v . Union of India 1964 (1) SCR 371 : 
“A statute, as passed by Parliament, is the expression of the collective intention of the legislature as a whole, and 
any statement made by an individual, albeit a Minister, of the intention and objects of the Act cannot be used to 
cut down the generality of the words used in the statute. ” 
At the same time, later decisions have relaxed the rigo r of this rule. In K.P. Varghese v. Income -tax Officer , 1982 
(1) SCR 629 , this court,  referring to the budget speech of the Minister stated : 
“Now it is true that the speeches made by the Members of the Legislature on the floor of the House when a Bill 
for enacting a statutory provision is being debated are inadmissible for the purpose of interpreting the statutory 
provision but the speech made by the Mover of the Bill explaining the reason for the introduction of the Bill can 
certainly be referred to for th e purpose of ascertaining the mischief sought to be remedied by the legislation and 
the object and purpose for which the legislation is enacted. ” 
 Other decisions following the same approach are Ramesh Yeshwant Prabhoo v. Prabhakar Kashinath Kunte  1995 
(Supp 6) SCR 371; Novartis AG v. Union of India  (2013) 6 SCC 1 ; Surana Steels (P) Ltd. v. C ommissioner of 
Income Tax 1999 (2) SCR 589 and Kalpana Mehta & Ors. v. Union of India (UOI) and Ors  2017 (7) SCC 295.  

activities. Whether such an entity is carrying on an activity in the nature of 
trade, commerce or business is a question of fact which will be decided bas ed 
on the  nature, scope, extent and frequency of the activity.  
3.1. There are industry and trade associations who claim exemption from tax 
u/s 11 on the ground that their  objects are for charitable purpose as these are 
covered under ‘any other object of ge neral public utility’.  Under the principle 
of mutuality, if trading takes place between persons who are associated 
together and  contribute to a common fund for the financing of some venture 
or object and in this respect have no dealings  
or relations with any outside body, then any surplus returned to the persons 
forming such association is not  chargeable to tax. In such cases, there must 
be complete identity between the contributors and the  participants.   
Therefore, where industry or trade a ssociations claim both to be charitable 
institutions as well as mutual  organizations and their activities are restricted 
to contributions from and participation of only their members,  these would 
not fall under the purview of the proviso to section 2(15) o wing to the 
principle of mutuality.  However, if such organizations have dealings with 
non-members, their claim to be charitable organizations  would now be 
governed by the additional conditions stipulated in the proviso to section 2 
(15).” 
 
114. Circular No. 1/2009  dated 27.03.2009 contains explanatory notes to 
provisions of the Finance Act, 2008. It inter alia reads as follows:  
“5. Streamlining the definition of "charitable purpose"  
5.1 Sub-section (15) of section 2 of the Act defines "charitable purpose" to  
include relief of the poor, education, medical relief, and the advancement of 
any other  object of general public utility. It has been noticed that a number 
of entities operating  on commercial lines are claiming exemption on their 
income either under sub -section  (23C) of section 10 or section 11 of the Act 
on the ground that they are charitable  institutions. This is based on the 
argument that they are engaged in the "advancement  of an object of general 
public utility" as is included in the fourth  limb of the current  definition of 
"charitable purpose". Such a claim, when made in respect of an activity  
carried out on commercial lines, is contrary to the intention of the provision.  
5.2 With a view to limiting the scope of the phrase “advancement of any 
other  object of general public utility", sub -section (15) of section 2 has been 
amended to  provide that the advancement of any other object of general 
public utility shall not be  a charitable purpose, if it involves the carrying on 
of any activity in the nature of  trade, commerce or business, or any activity 
of rendering any service in relation to  any trade, commerce or business, for 
a cess or fee or any other consideration,  irrespective of the nature of use or 
application, or retention,  of the income from such  activity. Scope of this 
amendment has further been explained by the CBDT vide its  circular 
no.11/2008 dated 19th Dec 2008.”  
 

115. Senior counsel  appearing  for the assesse es relied on Section 119 of the IT 
Act as well as decisions of this court, reported as Navnit Lal  Jhaveri (supra) and 
UCO Bank Calcutta (supra) and argued  that departmental circulars are binding 
upon tax administrators, and should be legitimately considered as aids of 
construction. This was in support of their reliance on the circulars in the present 
case (No.11/2008 and No. 1/2009).  
116. This court in Navn it Lal Jhaveri  (supra) considered Sections 2(6A)(e) and 
12(1B) of the IT Act  which were introduced by the Finance Act, 15 , 1955 (w.e.f. 
01.04.1955).  As a result of these amendments, the combined effect of the two 
provisions was that three kinds of payments  made to shareholders companies to 
which those applied, were treated as taxable dividend to the extent of the 
accumulated profits held by the company. The provision was challenged. It was  
noticed that while introducing the amendment, the Finance Minister assured that 
outstanding loans and advances – otherwise liable to taxation as dividends in AY 
1955 -56, would not be subjected to tax if it were shown that they had been 
genuinely refunded to the respective companies before 30 .06.1955. The 
government felt that unless such a step was taken, the operation of Section 12(1B) 
would lead to extreme hardship, as it would cover the aggregate of all outstanding 
loans of past years and could have led to unreasonably high liability on 
shareholders to whom the loans might have been advanced. A circular [No. 
20(XXI -6) /55] was issued by the Central Board of Revenue on 10.05.1955 . The 
court, in that context, observed that:  
“It is clear that a circular of t he kind which was issued by the Board would 
be binding on all officers and persons employed in the execution of the Act 
under s. 5(8) of the Act. This circular pointed out to all the officers that it 
was likely that some of the companies might have advance d loans to their 
shareholders as a result of genuine transactions of loans, and the idea was 
not to the effect such transactions and not to bring them within the mischief 
of the new provision.  
The officers were, therefore, asked to intimate to all the companies that if the 
loans were repaid before the 30th June, 1955, in a genuine manner, they would 
not be taken into account in determining the tax liability of the shareholders 
to whom they may have been advanced. In other words, past transactions 
which would normally have attracted the stringent provisions of s. 12(1B) as 

it was introduced in 1955, were substantially granted exemption from the 
operation of the said provisions by making it clear to all the companies and 
their shareholders that if the past  loans were genuinely refunded to the 
companies, they would not be taken into account under s. 12(1B). Section 
12(1B) would, therefore, normally apply to loans granted by the companies, 
to their respective shareholders with full notice of the provisions pr escribed 
by it.”  
 
117. This court ultimately upheld the amendments. As is evident, the judgment 
noticed that the circular sought to soften the rigors of the otherwise harsh 
consequence of immediate application of the amendment. There was nothing in 
the circular to make it applic able for all times to come. It was more in the nature 
of the government issuing a temporary suspension of operation of the substantive 
provision, introduced by the amendment.  
118.  In UCO Bank, Calcutta  (supra) , this court had to deal with circulars issue d 
under Section 145 regarding the method of accounting to be followed, in the 
context of bank loans to be written off, when an assessee was following the 
mercantile system (of accounting). The court inter alia, held that  under Section 
and efficient management of assessment and collection of revenue to issue 
general or special orders in respect of any class of incomes or class of cases 
setting forth directions or instructions,  not being prejudicial to assessees, as the 
guidelines, principles or procedures to be followed in the work relating to 
assessment.  The court held that the   
“9. […] The Board thus has power, inter alia, to tone down the rigour of the 
law and ensure a fair enforcement of its provisions, by issuing circulars in 
exercise of its statutory powers under Section 119 of the Income -tax Act 
which are binding on the authorities in the administration of the Act. Under 
Section 119(2)(a), however, the circulars as c ontemplated therein cannot be 
adverse to the assessee. Thus, the authority which wields the power for its 
own advantage under the Act is given the right to forego the advantage when 
required to wield it in a manner it considers just by relaxing the rigour of 
the law or in other permissible manners as laid down in Section 119. The 
power is given for the purpose of just, proper and efficient management of 
the work of assessment and in public interest. ”

119. The view expressed in Navnit Lal Jhaveri  (supra) , and later elaborated in 
UCO Bank (supra) appears to have found resonance in other decisions111 of this 
court. A recent  instance where this court took aid of explanatory circulars is in 
CIT v. Vatika Township112 when after holding that the amendment in question 
applied prospectively, the court also supported that holding by citing the 
revenue’s understanding about such prospective application, in a circular. What 
is of note in that judgment, is that the question o f whether circulars or explanatory 
notes issued by the executive are binding aids of construction was not discussed; 
more importantly, the court first interpreted the statute, in its own terms, and then 
cited the circular.  
120. That circulars are per se not binding upon courts, in regard to interpretation 
of a statutory provision and, at best are guides or aid to interpretation for 
departmental authorities, who are bound to take them into account, was pithily 
stated in Keshavji Ravji & Co. and Ors. v. Comm issioner of Income Tax113 where 
the court observed as follows:  
“This contention and the proposition on which it rests, namely, that all 
circulars issued by the Board have a binding legal quality incurs, quite 
obviously, the criticism of being too broadly stated. The Board cannot 
preempt a judicial interpretation of th e scope and ambit of a provision of the 
'Act' by issuing circulars on the subject. This is too obvious a proposition to 
require any argument for it. A circular cannot even impose on the tax payer 
a burden higher than what the Act itself on a true interpret ation envisages. 
The task of interpretation of the laws is the exclusive domain of the courts. 
However, this is what Sri Ramachandran really has in mind - circulars 
beneficial to the assessees and which tone down the rigour of the law issued 
in exercise of  the statutory power under Section 119 of the Act or under 
corresponding provisions of the predecessor Act are binding on the 
authorities in the administration of the Act. The Tribunal, much less the High 
Court, is an authority under the Act. The circulars  do not bind them. But the 
benefits of such circulars to the assessees have been held to be permissible 
even though the circulars might have departed from the strict tenor of the 
statutory provision and mitigated the rigour of the law. But that is not the 
same thing as saying that such circulars would either have a binding effect in 
the interpretation of the provision itself or that the Tribunal and the High 
Court are supposed to interpret the law in the light of the circular. There is,

however, support of certain judicial observations for the view that such 
circulars constitute external aids to construction.”  
 
121. This view was accepted in Commissioner of Customs v . Indian Oil 
Corporation114, which articulated the position with some degree of clarity. 
Commenting on Navnit Lal Jhaveri (supra) and other decisions, it was observed 
that: 
“30. No proposition was laid down in that case that even if the circular was 
clearly contrary to the provisions of the Act it should prevail, On the other 
hand, the learned Judges were inclined to view the circular as granting the 
benefit of exemption from  the operation of the impugned provisions subject 
to fulfilment of certain conditions. Navnit Lal's case was referred to and 
construed in two cases decided by Benches of two learned Judges. The first 
one was the case of Ellerman Lines Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax, 
West Bengal [1971]82ITR913(SC) and the other is K.P. Varghese v. I.T. 
Officer, Ernakulam [1981]131ITR597(SC) . In both these cases it was 
assumed that Navnit Lal's case was an authority for the proposition that even 
if the directions given i n the circular clearly deviate from the provisions of 
the Act, yet, the Revenue is bound by it. These three decisions were 
repeatedly referred to and relied on in the subsequent decisions in which the 
issue arose as regards the binding nature of the circul ars either under the 
Income Tax Act or under the Central Excise Act. In between, there was the 
three Judge Bench decision in Sirpur Paper Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of 
Wealth Tax [1970]77ITR6(SC) in which Section 13 of the Wealth Tax Act 
corresponding to S ection 5(8) of the Income Tax Act, 1922 fell for 
consideration. This Court took the view that the instructions issued by the 
Board may control the exercise of the power of the departmental officials in 
matters administrative but not quasi -judicial. There i s yet another decision 
of a three Judge Bench which seems to make a dent on the weight of the 
proposition that the circulars of the Board, even if they are plainly contrary 
to the provisions of the Act, should be given effect to and binding on the 
authorit ies concerned in the administration of the Act. That is the case of 
Keshavji Ravji & Co. v. I.T. Commissioner [1990] 183 ITR 1(SC)”  
 
122. In view of a conflict between decisions, on the binding nature of circulars 
issued by the Board (in the context of decisions of authorities dealing with 
indirect taxation issues) this court, by a five-judge  decision, in Ratan Melting and 
Wire Industries  (supra)  held that  
“6. Circulars and instructions issued by the Board are no doubt binding in 
law on the authorities under the respective statutes, but when the Supreme 
Court or the High Court declares the law on the question arising for 
consideration, it wou ld not be appropriate for the Court to direct that the 
 
114 2004 (2) SCR  511  

circular should be given effect to and not the view expressed in a decision of 
this Court or the High Court. So far as the clarifications/circulars issued by 
the Central Government and of the State Gov ernment are concerned they 
represent merely their understanding of the statutory provisions. They are 
not binding upon the court. It is for the Court to declare what the particular 
provision of st atute says and it is not for the Executive. Looked at from 
another angle, a circular which is contrary to the statutory provisions has 
really no existence in law.”  
 
123. In the opinion of this court, the views expressed in Keshavji Ravji, Indian 
Oil Corporation and Ratan Melting and Wire Industries (though th e last decision 
does not cite Navnit Lal  Jhaveri ), reflect the correct position, i.e. , that circulars 
are binding upon departmental authorities, if they advance a proposition within 
the framework of the statutory provision. However, if they are contrary to the 
plain words of a statute, they are not binding. Furthermore, they cannot bind the 
courts, which have to independently interpret the statute, in  their own terms. At 
best, in such a task, they may be considered as departmental understanding on the 
subject and have limited persuasive value. At the highest, they are binding on tax 
administrators and authorities, if they accord with and are not at odd s with the 
statute; at the worst, if they cut down the plain meaning of a statute, or fly on the 
face of their express terms, they are to be ignored.  
 
B. Interpretation of  Section 2(15),  the definition clause  
124. Section 2 of the Income Tax Act opens with the phrase “unless the context 
otherwise requires”. It has been held  in S.K. Gupta & Anr. v. K.P. Jain & Anr.115 
that where the definition of a term is preceded by this phrase , normally, the 
definition given in the  section “should be applied and given effect to but this 
normal rule can be deviated if there is something in the context to show that the 
definition should not be applied ”. This rule was also adopted in Indira Nehru 
Gandhi v. Shri Raj Narain and Anr.116 by Khanna, J and in Kalya Singh v. Genda

Lal and Ors117. Previously, in Vanguard Fire and Insurance Company Ltd. v. M/s. 
Fraser and Ross and Anr.118, it was held that the term “ unless the context 
otherwise requires” implies that the word or term so defined should be applied – 
subject to the context . It was held that in view of such a qualification, the Court 
has not only to look at the words but also to look at the context, collocation , and 
the object of such words in respect of such matters and fact or the meaning to be 
conveyed by the use of the words under the circumstances. Almost the same 
reasoning has been echoed in N.K. Jain and Ors. v. C.K. Shah and Ors119.  
125. The importance of terms expressly defined in a statute is that they are 
internal an d binding  aids to interpretation. The prefacing – to any definition – of 
the phrase “ unless the context otherwise requires ” merely signifies that in case 
there is anything expressly to the contrary, in any specific provision (s) in the body 
of the Act, a different meaning can be attributed. However, to discern the purport 
of a provision, the term, as defined has to prevail, whenever the expression  is used 
in the statute. This rule is subje ct to the  except ion that when a contrary i ntention  
is plain , in particular instances , that meaning is to be given . Therefore, in the light 
of the previous discussion, this court would interpret the true meaning of 
“charitable purpose” after its amendment in 2008 , taking into consideration the 
subsequent changes.   
126. As observed at the beginning of this judgment, GPU charities have been 
recognized as distinct from the ‘per se  categories ’ of charity (education, medical 
relief, relief to the poor ; and later - preservation of water sheds, monuments, 
environment , and yoga). The judgment of this court in Dharmadeepti  (supra)  has 
clarified that the per se categories  – are not subjected to the restrictive condition 
of eschewing activities of profit. This enunciatio n of the principle has been 
endorsed in all later decisions – starting with Surat Art Silk (supra). Therefore,

119 (1991) 1 SCR 938

the restriction imposed by Parliament against charities – prohibiting them from 
carrying on activities of profit do not apply to the first six ca tegories. Although 
the occasion did not so arise in Surat Art Silk (supra)  (since this Court was dealing 
with AYs prior to 1975 ), the provision in Section 13(1)(bb) which prevailed then 
with effect from 01.04.1977 made the position clearer in that it permi tted these 
per se  category charities , in the course of their actual carrying on of their 
activities, to earn profits. Of course, this provision was deleted from 01.04.1984. 
Alongside, the restriction imposed on GPUs from engaging in activities for profit , 
was also deleted.  
127. As noticed in Thanthi Trust  (supra) , Section 11(4A) was originally 
introduced with effect from 01.04.1984 and substituted w.e.f. 01.04.1991. At that 
stage, the statute as it stood, did not restrict GPU category charities from carrying 
on activities of profit or from carrying on business. This court nevertheless was 
bound by the decision in Surat Art  Silk (supra)  which had ruled that : 
(i) A GPU category charity with a constitution granting  discretion  to the 
trustees to engage in charitable and non -charitable activities , could not 
claim the exemption;  
(ii) The main or dominant purpose of the GPU category charity had to be 
essentially charitable. If it was so, and it incidentally entailed carrying 
on activities that led to profit, it was entitled to exemption.  
128. This court’s understanding of the law as exp ressed in Thanthi Trust  was 
therefore, coloured by the statute as it existed , and the formulation in Surat Art  
Silk (supra) . As a result, Thanthi Trust , interpreted Section 11(4A) in this 
background and held that the assessee in that case incidentally was engaged in 
activities for profit. The court was also of the opinion that Section 11(4A) was 
wider than the revenue urged it to be, in that activities by way of business could 
not be carried on incidentally by a Trust , which otherwise was a GPU category 
trust.  

129. As notic ed earlier, b etween Surat Art Silk (supra) and the decisions 
rendered thereafter  (i.e., Bar Council of Maharashtra , Federation of Indian 
Chamber of Commerce and Industries  and Thanthi Trust ) there were two changes 
in law  in 1983 w.e.f. 01.04.1984 – on the one hand deleting the restrictive words 
prohibiting GPU categories from carrying on profit , and deleting Section 
13(1)(bb) , and introducing Section 11(4A) , on the other. There was otherwise no 
meaningful statutory change.  The position therefore, continued as it was for about 
25 years.  
130. After its introduction, by amendment in 2008, Section 2(15) read as 
follows:  
(15) “charitable purpose” includes relief of the poor, education, medical 
relief, and the advancement of any other object of general public utility:  
Provided that the advancement of any other object of general public utility 
shall not be a charitable purp ose, if it involves the carrying on of any activity 
in the nature of trade, commerce or business, or any activity of rendering any 
service in relation to any trade, commerce or business, for a cess or fee or 
any other consideration, irrespective of the nat ure of use or application, or 
retention, of the income from such activity;”  
131. The term “in the nature of”  occurring in Section 2(15) has frequently been 
interpreted by this court. In G. Venkataswami Naidu v . Commissioner of Income 
Tax120 the isolated tra nsaction of sale of land was held not to be activity in the 
nature of trade or business. In State of Tamil Nadu v . Burmah Shell Oil Storage 
Distribution Company of India Ltd .121 the test indicated was whether the 
“frequency, volume, continuity and regularity of transactions carried on with a 
profit -motive ”. In State of Tamil Nadu v . Shakti Estates122, the assessee’s 
activities in leasing forest lands, clearing them, and creation of wooden sleepers, 
which were sold, as well as charcoal, which was sold , in a series of “sustained, 
systematic and organised activities”  was held to be in the nature of business. In

121 1973 (2) SCR 636  
122 1989 (1) SCR 408  

Director of Civil Supplies v . Member Board of Revenue123  this court outlined, 
what would be activity in the nature of business:  
“To regard an activity as business there must be a course of dealings, either 
actually continued or contemplated to be continued with a profit - motive; 
there must be some real and systematic or organised course of activity or 
conduct with a set purpose of making profit.  To infer from a course of 
transactions that it is intended thereby to carry on business ordinarily there 
must exist the characteristics of volume, frequency, continuity and system 
indicating an intention to continue the activity of carrying on the transac tions 
for a profit. But no single test or group of tests is decisive of the intention to 
carry on the business. “  
132. The term “ in relation to ” was interpreted in Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. 
v. General Electric Co.124 in an arbitration clause  - as follows:  
“25... (2) Expressions such as “arising out of or “in respect of or “in 
connection with ” or “in relation to ” or “in consequence of or “concerning ” 
or “relating to ” the contract are of the widest amplitude and content ..” 
In Mansukhlal Dhanraj Jain v. Eknath Vithal Ogale125 this court underlined 
the amplitude to the term “relating to ”: 
“16. It is, therefore obvious that the phrase “relating to recovery of 
possession ” as found in Section 41(1) of the Small Cause Courts Act is 
comprehensive in nature and takes in its sweep all types of suits and 
proceedings which are concerned with the recovery of possession of suit 
property from the licensee and, therefore, suits for p ermanent injunction 
restraining the Defendant from effecting forcible recovery of such possession 
from the licensee -Plaintiff would squarely be covered by the wide sweep of 
the said phrase.”  
In Doypack System (P) Ltd. v. Union of India126, this court ruled that the 
expression “in relation to ” is broad and is akin to the “concerning with ” and 
“pertaining to ”; and is also expansive. The court observed:  
“50. The expression “in relation to ” (so also “pertaining to ”), is a very broad 
expression which presupposes another subject matter. These are words of 
comprehensiveness which might have both direct significance as well as 
indirect significance depending on the context [internal citation omitted].

Assuming that the investments in shares and in lands do not form part of the 
undertaking but are different subject matters, even then these would be 
brought within the purview of the vesting by reason of the above expressions. 
In this connection reference may be made to 76 Corpus Juris Secundum at 
pages 620 and 621 where it is stated that the term “relate ” is also defined as 
meaning to bring into association or connection with. It has been clearly 
mentioned that “relating to ” has been held to be equivalent to or synonymous 
with as to “concerning with ” and “pertaining to ”. The expression “pertaining 
to” is an expression of expansion and not of contraction.”  
133. The position , therefore, with respect to what kind activities GPU charities 
could legitimately undertake, was in a state of flux till 2015 . However, the 
amendments cumulatively point to prohibitions that were constant:  
(1) the prohibition applicable to such charities involved in carrying on 
activities “in the nature of trade, commerce or business, or any activity of 
rendering any service in relation to any trade, commerce or business, for 
a cess or fee or any other considera tion”  
(2)  “irrespective of the nature of use or application, or retention, of the 
income from such activity ” (i.e. activity in the nature of trade, commerce 
or business for a cess, fee or other consideration).  
134. By retrospective amendment, in Section 2(15 ), after the proviso, a second 
proviso was inserted with effect from 01.04.2009  .- 
"Provided further  that the first proviso shall not apply if the aggregate value 
of the receipts from the activities referred to therein is ten lakh rupees or less 
in the pre vious year;";  
With the introduction of the second proviso, the resulting situation was that the 
first proviso (of exclusion of income through an activity as referred to) was 
inapplicable if the aggregate value of the receipts of such activity did not excee d 
₹10,00,000, and later by Finance Act, 2012 – this was enhanced to ₹25,00,000.  
135. The next important change took place through the Finance Act, 2015, 
which, w.e.f.  01.04.2016 substituted the two provisos to Section 2(15) with the 
following proviso:  

“Provided that the advancement of any other object of general public utility 
shall not be a charitable purpose, if it involves the carrying on of any activity 
in the nature of trade, commerce or business, or any activity of rendering any 
service i n relation to any trade, commerce or business, for a cess or fee or 
any other consideration, irrespective of the nature of use or application, or 
retention, of the income from such activity, unless —  
(i) such activity is undertaken in the course of actual carr ying out of such 
advancement of any other object of general public utility; and  
(ii) the aggregate receipts from such activity or activities during the 
previous year, do not exceed twenty per cent of the total receipts, of the 
trust or institution undertaking such activity or activities, of that 
previous year;”  
 
136. The limited relief, given by the second proviso, to GPU charities (for the 
period 2009 -2015) was that in case such GPU category charities did carry on 
activities  undertaken in the course of actual carrying out of their GPU objects 
that were  in the nature of trade, commerce or business, or rendered any service in 
relation to trade, business, etc ., and collected fee, cess, or other consideration, 
such income could still be exempt, if it did not exceed  ₹10,00,000  (and later,  
₹25,00,000 ). By the amendment of 2015, the second proviso was deleted and two 
conditions were introduced, with respect to permissibility of carrying on trade, 
commerce, etc:  
(i) such activity is undertaken in the course of actual carrying out of such 
advancement of any other object of general public utility; and  
(ii) the aggregate receipts from such activity or activities during the 
previous year, do not exceed twenty per cent of the t otal receipts, of the 
trust or institution undertaking such activity or activities, of that 
previous year.  
137. Having thus far discussed a nature of the changes to the term “charitable 
purpose” and how judicial thinking has shaped it, this court would now explore 
the all important question of the scope of the term of “ any other object generally 
public utility ” not being charitable purpose “if it involves the carrying on of any 
activity in the nature of trade, commerce or business or any activity of rendering 

any service in relation to any trade, commerce or business, for a cess or fee or 
any other consideration, irr espective  of the nature of use or application, or 
retention, of the income from such activity.”  
138. Parliamentary endeavour, was to alter the regime applicable to taxation of 
GPU category charities, under the IT Act. The absolute bar imposed on GPU 
charit ies from carrying on activities in the nature of trade, commerce or business, 
or of rendering any service in relation to any trade, commerce or business, for a 
cess or fee or any other consideration , evidences this intent. The o riginal Section 
2(15) did no t allude to trade, commerce or business , or any service in relation to 
such activities. It only enjoined the GPU charities from involving themselves 
from carrying on of any activity for profit127 (which was interpreted in Surat Art 
Silk).  This substantial change brought about by the amendments of 2008 -2012 
and 2015 is the  prohibition from engaging in any kind of  activity in the nature  of 
business, commerce, or trade or any rendering any service in relation thereto , and 
earning income by  the way of cess, fee or consideration.  In the opinion of this 
court, the express deletion of the reference to ‘activity for profit’ on the one hand, 
and the enactment of an expanded list of what cannot be done by GPU charities 
if they are to retain their characteristic as charities, is an emphatic manner in 
which Parliament wished to express itself.  
139. Counsel on both sides went to great lengths and cited several judgments 
for the proposition that “trade or business” are terms which imply profit -making. 
They relied on Khoday Distilleries (supra); M/s. Raipur Manufacturing (supra); 
Board of Trustees of the Port of Madras  (supra) , and Physical Research 
Laboratory v. K. G. Sharma128.  It was contended by the revenue, that the 
reference to terms “business, trade or commerce”  and “service in relation to”  
such activities are meant to imply that profit motive should be completely absent. 
 
127 “…the advancement of any other object of general public utility not involving the carrying on of any activity 
for profit "

At the same time - on behalf of the assesse es, it was contented that if the 
proscribed  activities i.e., business, commerce or trade or service in relation to 
such activities - is not the main or dominant object of the GPU charity , any 
incidental involvement in such activities is permissible .  Counsel on behalf of 
many assessees urged that s ome of them are statutory corporations charged  with  
develop ing housing industrial infrastructure sector, regulation of professions 
(such as chartered accountants , etc.).  It was underlined  that such corporations are 
agencies of the state, recognized as “S tate” under Article 12 of the Constitution , 
and carry out the essential purposes for which they were set up, which otherwise 
state departments would have been expected to carry out.  It was then emphasized 
that the activities of such corporations cannot be  characterized as motivated by 
profit - rather their essential purposes are to achieve objects of general public 
utility.  
140. In Town Investments v. Department of Environment129, it was  remarked 
that “business” is an ‘etymological chameleon ’. In NDMC  (supra) - while dealing 
with the question of immunity of states and state corporations, municipal 
corporations and local authorities from union taxation , this court (in a nine-judge 
bench composition) interpreted  Article 289 of the Constitution130 and discu ssed 
the nature of the activities that could be carried on by state or state agencies:  
“Section 155(1) which by its own force levied taxes upon the trading and 
business operations carried on by the Provincial Governments did not either 
define the said expr essions or specify which trading or business operations 
are subject to taxation. On this account, the proviso was not and could not 
be said to have been, ineffective or unenforceable. It was effective till 26 -1-
 
129 1977 1 ALLER 813  
130 289. Exemption of property and income of a State from Union taxation .—(1) The property and inc ome of a 
State shall be exempt from Union taxation.  
(2) Nothing in clause (1) shall prevent the Union from imposing, or authorising the imposition of, any tax to 
such extent, if any, as Parliament may by law provide in respect of a trade or business of any  kind carried on by, 
or on behalf of, the Government of a State, or any operations connected therewith, or any property used or 
occupied for the purposes of such trade or business, or any income accruing or arising in connection therewith.  
(3) Nothing in clause (2) shall apply to any trade or business, or to any class of trade or business, which 
Parliament may by law declare to be incidental to the ordinary functions of government.  
 

1950. Clause (2) of Article 289 also similarl y does not define or specify — 
nor does it require that the law made thereunder should so define or specify. 
It cannot be said that unless the law made under and with reference to clause 
(2) specifies the particular trading or business operations to be tax ed, it 
would not be a law within the meaning of clause (2). Coming back to the 
language of clause (2), a question is raised, why does the proviso speak of 
taxation  in respect of trade or business  when the main limb of sub -section 
(1) speaks only of taxes i n respect of lands or buildings and income? Is the 
ambit of proviso wider than the main limb? Is it an independent provision of 
a substantive nature notwithstanding the label given to it as a proviso? Or is 
it only an exception? It is asked. We are, howeve r, of the considered opinion 
that it is more important to give effect to the language of and the intention 
underlying the proviso than to find a label for it. It is clarificatory in nature 
without a doubt; it appears to be more indeed. It is concerned main ly with 
the “income” (of Provincial Governments) referred to in the main limb of 
sub-section (1). It speaks of tax on the “lands or buildings” in that context 
alone, as we shall explain in the next paragraph. The idea underlying the 
proviso is to make it c lear that the exemption of income of Provincial 
Government operates only where the income is earned or received by it as a 
Government; it will not avail where the income is earned or received by the 
Provincial Government on account of or from any trade or business carried 
on by it — that is  a trade or a business carried on with profit motive. In the 
light of the language of the proviso to Section 155 and clause (2) of Article 
289, it is not possible to say that every activity carried on by the Government 
is governmental activity. A distinction has to be made between governmental 
activity  and trade and business carried on by the Government, at least for 
the purposes of this clause. It is for this reason, we say, that unless an activity 
in the nature of trade and business is carried on with a profit motive, it would 
not be a trade or business contemplated by clause (2). For example, mere 
sale of government properties, immovable or moveable, or granting of leases 
and licences in respect of its properties does no t amount to carrying on trade 
or business. Only where a  trade or business  is carried on with a profit motive 
— or any property is used or occupied for the purpose of carrying on such 
trade or business — that the proviso [or for that matter clause (2) of Ar ticle 
289] would be attracted. Where there is no profit motive involved  in any 
activity  carried on by the State Government, it cannot be said to be carrying 
on a trade or business within the meaning of the proviso/clause (2), merely 
because some profit res ults from the activity [ For example, almost every 
State Government maintains one or more guest houses in Delhi for 
accommodating their officials and others connected with the affairs of the 
State. But, when some rooms/accommodation are not occupied by suc h 
persons and remain vacant, outsiders are accommodated therein, though at 
higher rates. This activity cannot obviously be called carrying on trade or 
business nor can it be said that the building is used or occupied for the 
purpose of any trade or busines s carried on by the State Government.] . We 
may pause here a while and explain why we are attaching such restricted 
meaning to the words “trade or business” in the proviso to Section 155 and 
in clause (2) of Article 289. Both the words import substantially  the same 
idea though, ordinarily speaking, the expression “business” appears to be 
wider in its content. The expression, however, has no definite meaning; its 

meaning varies with the context and several other factors. … Having regard 
to the context in whi ch the words “trade or business” occur — whether in 
the proviso to Section 155 of the Government of India Act, 1935 or in clause 
(2) of Article 289 of our Constitution — they must be given, and we have 
given, a restricted meaning, the context being levy of  tax by one unit of 
Federation upon the income of the other unit, the manifold activities carried 
on by Governments under our constitutional scheme, the necessity to 
maintain a balance between the Centre and the States and so on.”    
       (emphasis supplied)  
141. From NDMC  (supra) , it is clear that not  every state activity resembling 
commerce can be considered per se  exempt from union taxation , in the context 
of Article 289. The court also emphasized that mere sale or lease of government 
property does not imply trade or business. The crucial or determinative element 
in the venture, so to say, is whether performance of a function is actuated by profit 
motive.  
142. What then is the true meaning of the expressions “ fee, cess or 
consideration ”? The careful analysis of the amended proviso to Section 2(15), 
reveal that the prohibition applies in a four-fold manner - 
(a) The bar to engaging in trade, commerce or business , 
(b) The bar to providing  any service in relation to trade, commerce or 
business , 
(c) wherein “ for a fee, cess or any other consideration ” is the 
controlling phrase for both ( a) and ( b) (which are collectively 
referred to as “prohibited activities ” for brevity)  
(d) irrespective of the application of the income  derived from such 
‘prohibited activities ’.   
143. The impermissibility of any trade, or commercial  activity or service, and 
income, from them, was intended to be conveyed through the prohibition, in the 
first part of the definition of  GPU charities.  The necessary implicati on which 
arises is that income  (received as fee, cess, or any other consideration)  derived 
from such ‘prohibited activities’ is necessarily motivated by profit .  The ordinary 
meaning of fee or consideration would be synonymous with something of value, 

usually in monetary terms.  However, the use of the expression “cess” facially 
lends a different colour to all the three expressions.  
144.  “Fee, cess and any other consideration ”  has to receive a purposive 
interpretation, in the present context. If fee or cess or such consideration is 
collected for the purpose of an activity, by a state department or entity, which is 
set up by statute, its mandate to collect such amounts cannot be  treated as 
consideration  towards trade or business. Therefore, regulatory activity, 
necessitating fee or cess collection in terms of enacted law, or collection of 
amounts in furtherance of  activities such as education, regulation of profession, 
etc., are per se not business or commercial in nature. Likewise, statutory boards 
and authorities, who are under mandate to develop housing, industrial and other 
estates, including development of res idential housing at reasonable or subsidized 
costs, which might entail charging higher amounts from some section of the 
beneficiaries, to cross -subsidize the main activity, cannot be characterized as 
engaging in business. The character of being ‘state’, and such corporations or 
bodies set up under specific laws  (whether by states or the centre) would , 
therefore , not mean that the amounts are ‘fee’ or ‘cess’ to provid e some 
commercial or business service.  In each case, at the same time, the mere 
nomenclature  of the consideration being a “fee” or “cess”, is not conclusive. If 
the fee or cess, or other consideration is to provide an essential service, in larger 
public interest, such as water cess or sewage cess or fee, such consideration, 
received by a statutor y body, would not be considered “trade, commerce or 
business” or service in relation to those.  Non-statutory bodies, on the other hand, 
which may mimic regulatory or development bodies - such as those which 
promote trade, for a section of business or indus try, or are aimed at providing 
facilities or amenities to improve efficiencies, or platforms to a segment of 
business, for fee, whether charged by subscription, or specific fee, etc, may not 
be charitable ; when they claim exemption, their cases   would require further 
scrutiny . 

145. This Court has in some decisions considered the term "cess". In  Shinde 
Brothers Etc. v. Deputy Commissioner, Raichur and Ors .131, Justice M. 
Hidyatullah , (though his was a dissenting judgment, yet no contrary opinion was 
expressed by majority in regard to “cess”) said that:  
“... The word "cess" is used in Ireland and is still in use in India although the 
word rate has replaced it in England. It means a ta x and is generally used 
when the levy is for some special administrative expense which the name 
(health cess, education cess, road cess etc.) indicates. When levied as an 
increment to an existing tax, the name matters not for the validity of the cess 
must be judged of in the same way as the validity of the tax to which it is an 
increment. By Schedule A(1) read with Section 3 of the Act, it is collected as 
an additional levy with a tax, which, as described in Schedule A, is 
undoubtedly one within the powers of the State Legislature and has been so 
even prior to the Constitution....”  
146. The seven -judge bench judgment of this court in  India Cement Ltd. & Ors. 
v. State of Tamil Nadu and Ors .132, approved the definition propounded by 
Hidayatulla, J. In  Vijayalas hmi Rice Mill and Ors. v. Commercial Tax Officers, 
Palakol & Ors133 this court observed that  
“13. Hence ordinarily a cess is also a tax, but is a special kind of tax. 
Generally tax raises revenue which can be used generally for any purpose by 
the State. For  instance, the income tax or excise tax or sales tax are taxes 
which generate revenue which can be utilised by the Union or the State 
Governments for any purpose e.g. for payment of salary to the members of the 
armed forces or civil servants, police, etc. or for development programmes, 
etc. However, cess is a tax which generates revenue which is utilised for a 
specific purpose. For instance, health cess raises revenue which is utilised for 
health purposes e.g. building hospitals, giving medicines to the poo r, etc. 
Similarly, education cess raises revenue which is used for building schools or 
other educational purposes.”  
147. The expression "cess" , therefore, implies a tax or impost levied for some 
special purpose, which may be levied as an increment to an ex isting tax. The term 
“fee”, to some extent, has a similar meaning. In  The Commissioner of Income 
Tax, Lucknow v. U.P. Forest Corporation134 this court, after considering other 
 
131 1967 (1) SCR 548  
132 1989 (Supp 1) SCR 692  
134 1998 (2) SCR 22

previous decisions, held that exaction, through process of law, of amounts may 
be called “fee” but broadly are taxes:  
“compulsory exaction's of money imposed for public purpose and requiring 
no consideration to sustain it, but in a broad generic sense as to also include 
fees levied essentially for services rendered. It is now well re cognised that 
there is no generic difference between a tax and a fee; both are compulsory 
exaction of money by public authority.”  
148. At the same time, there is also authority135 for the proposition that charges 
(which may be termed as “fee” in given statu tes) collected by local or municipal 
authorities, for supply of water, for sewerage, etc ., are not “taxes” - they form 
consideration for the specific services, by the concerned local authority.  
149. The term “consideration” however is broader. The plain meaning is a 
monetary payment, for something obtained, in the form of goods, or services. 
In Commissioner of Central Excise, Mumbai v. Fiat India (P) Ltd. & Ors136 this 
court explained the meaning of th at term:  
“Consideration means something which is of value in the eyes of law, 
moving from the Plaintiff, either of benefit to the Plaintiff or of detriment to 
the Defendant. In other words, it may consist either in some right, interest, 
profit or benefit a ccruing to the one party, or some forbearance, detriment, 
loss or responsibility, given, suffered or undertaken by the other, as 
observed in the case of Currie v. Misa (1875) LR 10 Ex. 153.  
54. Webster's Third New International Dictionary (unabridged) defi nes, 
consideration thus:  
‘Something that is legally regarded as the equivalent or return given or 
suffered by one for the act or promise of another.’  
55. In volume 17 of Corpus Juris Secundum (p.420 -421 and 425) the 
import of 'consideration' has been descr ibed thus:  
‘Various definitions of the meaning of consideration are to be found in the 
text-books and judicial opinions. A sufficient one, as stated in Corpus Juris 
and which has been quoted and cited with approval is "a benefit to the 
party promising or a  loss or detriment to the party to whom the promise 
is made.....

Offices, Amritsar Division & Anr. 2004 (1) SCR 913.

At common law every contract not under seal requires a consideration to 
support it, that is, as shown in the definition above, some benefit to the 
promisor, or some detriment to the promisee. ’ 
56. In Salmond on Jurisprudence, the word 'consideration' has been 
explained in the following words.  
A consideration in its widest sense is the reason, motive or inducement, by 
which a man is moved to bind himself by an agreement. It is for nothing 
that he consents to impose an obligation upon himself, or to abandon or 
transfer a right. It is in consideration of such and such a fact that he agrees 
to bear new burdens or to forego the benefits which the law already allows 
him. 
57. The gist of the term 'con sideration' and its legal significance has been 
clearly summed up in Section 2(d) of the Indian Contract Act which 
defines 'consideration' thus:  
‘When, at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has 
done or abstained from doing, or doe s or abstains from doing, or promises 
to do or to abstain from doing, something, such act or abstinence or 
promise is called a consideration to the promise.’  
58. From a conspectus of decisions and dictionary meaning, the 
inescapable conclusion that follows is that 'consideration' means a 
reasonable equivalent or other valuable benefit passed on by the promisor 
to the promisee or by the transferor to the transfe ree. Similarly, when the 
word 'consideration' is qualified by the word 'sole', it makes consideration 
stronger so as to make it sufficient and valuable having regard to the facts, 
circumstances and necessities of the case.”  
150. Therefore, what Parliament intended – through the amendments in question 
was to proscribe, involvement or engagement of GPU charities, from any form 
(“in the nature of ”) of activities that were trade, business or commerce, or engage 
or involve in providing services in relation to trade, business or commerce - for a 
fee, cess or other consideration. The inclusion of the term “ in the nature of ” was 
by design, to clarify beyond doubt, that not only business, trade or commerce, but 
all activities in the nature of, or resembling  them, were  proscribed. Likewise, 
service in relation to such activities, i.e. , services relating, or pertaining to, such 
proscribed activities, too were forbidden.   
151. The reference to fee or cess, is in the opinion of the court, only to 
emphasize that even a statutory consideration, for a service to business, trade or 
commerce, would take the activity outside the definition of a GPU charity. The 

sense in which the expre ssions “ cess, fee or other consideration ” are used, is that 
if any amount, is received for trading, or business or commercial activity, or any 
services to such activity, then, notwithstanding their nomenclature (as fee or cess, 
i.e. that they are fixed und er a law) the GPU charity cannot claim tax exempt 
status. To bring home this even more pointedly - and underline a break from the 
past, the application of such amounts (received in the course of trade, commerce, 
or business, or towards services in relation thereto) would be irrelevant , as 
evidenced by the term “ irrespective ”, in the fourth limb of reading Section 2(15).  
 
Summation of interpretation of Section 2(15)  
152. Section 2(15) - in the wake of its several amendments between 2008 and 
2015 - can be juxtaposed with the interpretation of the unamended Section 2(15) 
by this Court. In Surat Art Silk (supra), the principle enunciated was that so long 
as the predominant ob ject of GPU category charity is charitable, its engagement 
in a non -charitable object resulting in profits that are incidental, is permissible. 
The court also declared that profits and gains from such activities which were 
non-charitable had to be deployed  or “fed” back to achieve the dominant 
charitable object.  
153. The paradigm change achieved by Section 2(15) after its amendment in 
2008 and as it stands today, is that firstly a GPU charity cannot engage in any 
activity in the nature of trade, commerce, b usiness or any service in relation to 
such activities for any consideration (including a statutory fee etc.). This is 
emphasized in the negative language employed by the main part of Section 2(15). 
Therefore, the idea of a predominant object  among several other objects, is 
discarded. The prohibition is relieved to a limited extent, by the proviso which 
carves out the condition by which otherwise prohibited activities can be engaged 
in by GPU charities. The conditions are:  

(a) That such activities in the nature of trade, commerce, business or 
service (in relation to trade, commerce or business for consideration) 
should be in the course of “actual carrying on” of the GPU object, and  
(b) The quantum of receipts from such activities should be exceed 20% of 
the total rec eipts.  
(c) Both parts of the proviso: (i) and (ii) (to Section 2 (15)) have to be read 
conjunctively -given the conscious use of “or” connecting the two of 
them. This means that if a charitable trust carries on any activity in the 
nature of business, trade or c ommerce , in the actual course of fulfilling 
its objectives, the income from such business, should not exceed the 
limit defined in sub -clause (ii) to the proviso.  
 
C. Sections 10, 11, 12, 12A, 12AA and 13  of the IT Act  
154. The effect of Sections 11, 12, 12A 12AA and 13 have been the subject of 
certain decisions137 of this court. These decisions have noticed that Section 11 
deals with income from trusts for charitable and religious purposes and sets out 
which shall be subject to tax. Section 11(1) relates t o application of income 
towards the objects of the trust and exempts income of trusts with objects wholly 
charitable or religious , or parts of income which relate to such objects. Section 
11(1-A) provides for exemption of capital gains derived by trusts. S ection 11(1 -
B), speaks of failure to apply income as per option under Explanation (2) to 
Section 11(1). Section 11(2) relates to setting apart or accumulation of income. 
Section 11(3) deals with consequences of misapplication of income or improper 
investme nt, while Section 11(3 -A) relates to modification of purposes specified 
in Form 10 under Section 11(2) . Sections 11(4) and 11(4 -A) relate to business 
income of charitable trusts. Lastly, Section 11(5) provides for the prescribed 
 
137 Commissioner of Income Tax v. Dawoodi Bohara Jamat , (2014) 16 SCC 222; S.RM.M.CT.M. Tiruppani 
Trust v. Commissioner of Income Tax , (1998) 2 SCC 584  

modes of investment in rega rd to the said trusts.  Section 12 enacts that income of 
trusts created wholly for charitable or religious purpose from voluntary 
contributions would be deemed as income from the property held under such trust 
for the purposes of Sections 11 and 13 of the A ct. Section 12 -A prescribes the 
conditions for applicability of Sections 11 and 12 of the Act. It enacts two 
essential conditions which are to be satisfied by a charitable  or religious trust for 
claiming exemption under those sections:  firstly , that the pe rson in receipt of the 
income has made an application for registration of the trust on or after 01.06.2007  
in the prescribed form and manner to the Commissioner and such a trust is 
registered under Section 12 -AA and  secondly , where the total income of the trust 
exceeds the maximum amount which is not chargeable to income tax in any 
previous year, the accounts of the trust must be audited by a chartered accountant 
and the person in receipt of the income should furnish such audit report in the 
prescribed form  along with the return of income. The procedure for grant (or 
refusal) of registration is prescribed by Section 12AA. Section 13 enlists the 
circumstances under which tax exemption is unavailable to religious or charitable 
trusts otherwise falling under Se ctions 11 or 12. Section 13 therefore, has to be 
read with the provisions of Sections 11 and 12 for deciding eligibility of a trust’s 
claim for exemption.  
 
Distinction between business held under Trust  [Section 11(4)] and Trust 
carrying on business [Section 11(4A)]  
155. Section 11(4) applies to cases where the business undertaking itself is the 
property held by a trust .  Thus, where the property held in trust, or where property 
settled by the donor or trust creator in favour of the trustees itself i s a business 
undertaking, then the income from such an undertaking is covered by Section 
11(4). Section 11(4A) operates differently. It is applicable to cases where the trust 
carries on a business.  Section 11(4A) states that when a trust carries on a 
business, unless the business is incidental or ancillary to the attainments of the 

objectives of the trust, it would be disentitled to an exemption under Section 
11(1).  It imposes a further condition that separate books of accounts need to be 
maintained in su ch cases.  
156. Section 11(1) confers an exemption from tax only where the property itself 
is held under a trust or other legal obligation.  It does not apply to cases where a 
trust or legal obligation is not created on any property, but only the income 
derived from any particular property or source is set apart and charged for a 
charitable or religious purpose.  Similarly, when a business itself has been set 
aside for the objects of the trust, then such business is held under trust and will 
fall under sub-section  (4).  However, where the profits of a business o f a trust are 
appli ed for charitable purposes, then such business and trust will be governed by 
sub-section  (4A).  
157. Section 11(1) of the Act exempts income derived from property held under 
trust wh olly for charitable or religious purposes, to the extent to which such 
income is applied to such purposes in India. The Act does not comprehensively 
define " property held under trust ". Section 11(4) however, provides that for the 
purposes of Section 11, th e words "property held under trust" "includes a 
business undertaking so held".  Section 11(4A) as amended by the Finance (No. 
2) Act, 1991 w.e.f. 01.04.1992 reads as under: - 
"(4A) Sub -section (1) or sub -section (2) or sub -section (3) or sub -section (3A) 
shall not apply in relation to any income of a trust or an institution, being 
profits and gains of business, unless the business is incidental to the 
attainment of the objectives of the trust or, as the case may be, institution, and 
separate books of account are maintained by such trust or institution in 
respect of such business."  
158. The question whether Section 11(4A) applies where a business is held 
under trust was answered in the negative in earlier High Court judgments . The 
general provision under Section 4(3)(i) of the old Act  exempted income derived 
from property held under trust from taxation. Section 4(3)(ia) however, enacted 
that any income derived from a business carried on behalf of a religious or 

charitable trust  would be entitled to exemption only if the business was carried 
on in the course of carrying out of a primary purpose of the trust or the work in 
connection with the business is mainly carried on by the beneficiaries of the trust.  
The revenue contended th ere that since clause (ia) was a special provision dealing 
with exemption in respect of a business carried on for and on behalf of a trust, 
any claim for exemption as regards the profits of such business can be made only 
under that provision, and if condit ions laid down therein are not satisfied, the 
assessee cannot rely upon the general provision contained in Section 4(3)(i) to 
claim exemption thereunder on the ground that business is property. In Gadodia 
Swadeshi Stores v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Punj ab138, the Lahore High 
Court  held that the fact that the  business carried on behalf of the trust failed to 
satisfy the two conditions in Section 4(3)(ia) was no reason for it be denied 
exemption if it fell within Section 4(3)(i). The court held that that th e two 
categories mentioned in the two clauses did not exclude each other.  
159. This judgment of the Lahore High Court was approved - by reference by 
this court in J.K. Trust v. CIT139 which  was followed in Krishna Warriar  (supra) . 
By then the content of Section 4(3)(ia) had been enacted as a proviso to clause  (i) 
of Section 4(3), by amending Act of 1953. After referring to the judgment of the 
Lahore High Court (supra) and rejecting the argument of the revenue that a 
proviso in a statute be always read as limitation upon the effect of the main 
enactment Subbarao, J. in Krishna Warri ar (supra) observed as under:  
“........But it is not an inflexible rule of construction that a proviso in a statute 
should always be read as a limitation upon the effect of the main enactment. 
Generally the natural presumption is that but for the proviso the enacting part 
of the section would have included the subject -matter of the proviso; but the 
clear language of the substantive provision as well as the proviso m ay 
establish that the proviso is not a qualifying clause of the main provision, but 
is in itself a substantive provision. In the words of Maxwell, "the true principle 
is that the sound view of the enacting clause, the saving clause and the proviso 
taken an d construed together is to prevail". So construed we find no difficulty, 
 
138 See Gadodia Swadeshi Stores v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Punjab,  (1944) 12 ITR 385  
139 1958 (1) SCR 65  

as we will indicate later in our judgment, in holding that the said clause (b) 
of the proviso deals with a case of business which is not vested in trust for 
religious or charitable pu rposes within the meaning of the substantive clause 
of section 4(3)(i).”  
160. Therefore, to summarise on the legal position on this - if a property is held 
under trust, and such property is a business, the case would fall under Section 
11(4) and not under Section 11(4A) of the Act. Section 11(4A) of the Act, would 
apply only to a case where the business is not held under trust. There is a 
difference between a property or business held under trust and a business carried 
on by or on behalf of the trust. This distinction was recognized in Surat Art Silk  
(supra) , which observed that if a business undertaking is held under trust for a 
charitable purpose, the income from it would be entitled to exemption under 
Section 11(1) of the Act.  
161. The interface between Sections 11(1) and (4) is of some importance. 
Firstly , under Section 11(4), it is only the business which is held under the trust 
that would enjoy exemption in respect of its income under Section 11(1). 
Secondly , there is a distinctio n between the objects of a trust and the powers given 
to the trustees to effectuate the purposes of the trust. In this regard, the 
observations of this court, in J.K. Trust (supra) assume relevance. There, one of 
the questions which arose was whether the o ffice of managing agency , which was 
an office of profit , was in fact settled upon trust and, therefore, could be 
considered to be business held under trust. The court held that for the purposes of 
Section 4(3)(i) of the 1922 Act, the office of managing age ncy was property 
which could be held under trust. The revenue pointed out that on the terms of the 
trust deed previously executed by the settlors (on 15.06.1945 ), the properties 
which the trustees are to hold and stand possessed of , were only the sum of 
₹1,00,000/ -, any donations and contribution received by the trustees and all 
accretions thereto , and investment in securities made from time to time 
representing the accretions . It was contended that on the terms of the trust deed, 
the managing agency which was acquired on 10.09.1945 for a period of 20 years , 

cannot be said to be property held under trust since no part of the initial amount 
of  ₹1,00,000/ -, which was settled upon the trust, was utilised in the acquisition 
of the managing agency , so as to impr ess it with the character of accretion. While 
repelling this contention, this court held that:  
“.......But it is to be observed that clause (3) of the trust deed expressly 
provides for the acquisition of the business of managing agency on behalf of 
the tru st and "with the help of the trust fund" and that precisely is what has 
happened and indeed, reading together Exhibits A and B, it is impossible to 
resist the conclusion that both the documents formed part of an integral 
scheme, and that what the settlors had in view in clause 3 of Exhibit A is the 
very managing agency, which was acquired under Exhibit B. There is 
considerable authority in England that when trustees carry on business with 
the aid of trust fund, the position in law is the same as if they act ually 
employed it in the business, though, in fact, it be not actually invested 
therein.”  
162. It seems that the test applied in J.K. Trust  (supra) that for a business, to be 
considered as property held under trust, it should have been either acquired with 
the help of the fund originally settled upon trust or the original fund settled upon 
trust must have a proximate connection with the later acquisit ion or carrying on 
of the business by the trustees. This distinction between a business held and 
carried on by a trust, or a trust business run by the trustees, was noticed, in 
Thiagesar Dharma Vanikam v. CIT140 by the Madras High Court  and in Raja P.C. 
Lall Choudhary v. CIT, Bihar & Orissa141  by the Patna High Court  which held 
similarly in relation to Section 4(3)(i) of the Act of 1922  (which corresponds to 
Section 11(1) of the 1961 Act ). 
163. What has to be examined , therefore,  is whether the business itse lf is held 
under trust or is carried on by and on behalf of the trust . Importantly Section 
11(1) of the Act starts with the expression "subject to the provisions of Sections 
60 to 63........" . Those provisions are in Chapter V of the Act. Section 60 provid es 
for the consequences of a transfer of income where there is no transfer of assets.

It says that where a person transfers merely the income from an asset without 
transferring the asset itself, he would continue to be chargeable to income tax. 
Section 61 provides for the consequences of a revocable transfer of assets and 
says that the same would be the position where a person is in receipt of income 
by virtue of a revocable transfer of assets. Section 62 provides for the 
consequences of a transfer of asset s for a specified period , and serves as an 
exception to Section 61. An assessee has to be divested of the asset before ceasing 
to be assessable in respect of the income from it. A mere direction that the income 
from the business shall be applied to the charitable objects of a trust, without there 
being a settlement of the business itself upon trust, does not result in any trust or 
legal obligation.  
164. It is now, necessary to consider Thanthi Trust  (supra)  and its context. This 
court, while interpreting  Section 11(4A) (as amended w.e.f. 01.04.1992) stated 
that the provision requires the “ business income of a trust or institution to  be 
exempt is that the business should be incidental to the attainment of objectives of 
the trust or institution” . 
165. The a bove observations have to be understood in the light of the facts 
before the court. Thanthi Trust carried on newspaper business which was held 
under trust . The charitable object of the trust was the imparting of education  - 
which falls under Section 2(15) of the Act. The newspaper business was 
incidental to the attainment of the object of the trust, namely that of imparting 
education . This aspect is important, because the aim of the trust was a per se 
charitable object, not a GPU object . The observations we re therefore made , 
having regard to the fact that the profits of the newspaper business were utilized 
by the trust for achieving the object of education . In the light of such facts, the 
carrying on of newspaper business, could be incidental to the object of education - 
a per se category. The Thanthi Trust  (supra) ratio therefore, cannot be extended 

to cases where the trust carries on business which is not held under trust and 
whose income is utilized to feed the charitable objects of the trust.   
166. What then is the interpre tation of the expression “incidental” profits, from 
“business” being “incidental to the attainment of the objectives” of the GPU 
charity  (which occurs in Section 11(4A) )? As stated earlier, the  interpretation of 
that expression in Thanthi  Trust (supra) was in the context of a per se charity, i.e. , 
where the trust’s object was education. However, the restrictive or negative terms 
enjoining GPU charities from carrying on profitable activity had been deleted in 
determinative test for defining  whether a Trust was a GPU charity if its 
predominant object was to carry out a charitable purpose and that if that was the 
case, the fact that it earned profit would not per se deprive it of  tax exemption. 
This decision was interpreted in the context of Section 11(4A) by this court in 
Thant hi Trust , to hold that business can be incidental to attainment of the trust’s 
objects.  
167. Thus, the journey which began with Surat Art  Silk was interpreted in 
Thant hi Trust to mean that the carrying on of business by GPU charity was 
permissible as long as it inured to the benefit of the trust. The change brought 
about by the amendments in quest ions, however, place the focus on an entirely 
different perspective: that if at all any activity in the nature of trade , commerce 
or business, or a service in the nature of the same,  for any form of consideration 
is permissible, that activity should be int rinsically linked to, or a part of the GPU 
category  charity’s object. Thus, the test of the charity being driven by a 
predominant  object is no longer good law. Likewise, the ambiguity with respect 
to the kind of activities generating profit which could fee d the main object and 
incidental profit -making also is not good law. What instead, the definition under 
Section 2(15) through its proviso directs  and thereby marks a departure from the 
previous law,  is – firstly  that if a GPU charity is to engage in any ac tivity in the 

Citations:
1983  (w.e.f. 01.04.1984) . In Surat Art Silk  (supr a), the court had articulated the

nature of trade , commerce or business , for consideration it should only be a part 
of this actual  function to attain the GPU objective and, secondly  – and the equally 
important consideration is the imposition of a quantitative standard - i.e., income 
(fees, cess or other consideration ) derived from activity in the nature of trade, 
business or commerce or service in relation to these three activities , should not 
exceed the quantitative limit of ₹10,00,000  (w.e.f. 01.04.2009), ₹25,00,000 
(w.e.f. 01.04.201 2), and 20% (w.e.f. 01.04.2016) of the total receipts.  Lastly, the 
“ploughing” back of business income to “feed” charity is an irrelevant factor – 
again emphasizing the prohibition from engaging in trade, commerce or business.  
168. If one underst ands the definition in the light of the above enunciation, the 
sequitur is that the reference to “income being profits and gains of business”  with 
a further reference to its being incidental  to the objects of the Trust, cannot and 
does not mean proceeds of  activities  incidental to the main object, incidental 
objects  or income derived from incidental activities . The proper way of reading 
reference to the term “incidental” in Section 11(4A) is to interpret it in the light 
of the sub -clause (i) of proviso to S ection 2(15), i.e. , that the activity in the nature 
of business, trade, commerce or service in relation to such activities should be 
conducted actually in the course of achieving the GPU object , and  the income, 
profit or surplus or gains can then, be logic ally incidental . The amendment of 
2016, inserting sub clause (i) to proviso to Section 2(15) was therefore 
clarificatory. Thus interpreted, there is no conflict between the definition of 
charitable purpose and the machinery part of Section 11(4A). Further,  the 
obligation under Section 11(4A) to maintain separate books of account in respect 
of such receipts is to ensure that the quantitative limit imposed by sub -clause (ii) 
to Section 2(15) can be computed and ascertained in an objective manner.  

169. The conclusion recorded above is also supported by the language of 
seventh proviso142 to Section 10(23C). Whereas Section 2(15) is the definition 
clause, Section 10 lists out what is not income .  Section 10(23C)  – by sub -clauses 
(iv) and (v) exempt incomes of charitable organisations. Such organisations and 
institutions are not limited to GPU category charities but rather extend to other 
types of charities (i.e. the per se  kind as well). The controlling part of Section 
10(23C) along with the relevant clauses (iv) and (v) seek to exclude income 
received by the concerned charities. However, t he provisos hedge such exemption 
with conditions. The seventh proviso  - much like Section 11(4A) and the 
definition  - carve out an exception, to the exemptions such that income derived 
by charities from business, are not exempt. The seventh proviso virtual ly echoes 
Section 11(4A) in that business income derived by a charity (in the present case, 
the GPU charities) which arises from an activity incidental to the attainment of 
its objective is not per se excluded.  
170. Classically, the idea of charity was tie d up with eleemosynary143. However, 
“charitable purpose” – and charity as defined in the Act have a wider meaning 
where it is the object of the institution which is in focus. Thus, the idea of 
providing services or goods at no consideration, cost or nominal  consideration is 
not confined to the provision of services or goods without charging anything or 
charging a token or nominal amount. This is spelt out in Indian Chamber of 
Commerce (supra)  where this Court held that certain GPUs can render services 
to the  public with the condition that they would not charge “more than is actually 
needed for the rendering of the services, - may be it may not be an exact 
equivalent, such mathematical precision being impossible in the case of 
 
142 “Provided  also that nothing contained in sub -clause (iv) or sub -clause (v) or sub -clause (vi) or sub -clause 
(via) shall apply in relation to any income of the fund or trust or institution or any university or other educational 
institution or any hospital or other medical institution, being profits and gains of business, unless the business is 
incidental to the attainment of its objectives and separ ate books of account are maintained by it in respect of such 
business:”  
143 Providing relief from distress to humans based on Christian values  - refer to Director of Income Tax v. Bharat 
Diamond Bourse (2002) 10 SCC 392 , and Bangalore Water Supply and Sewage  Undertaking v. A Rajappa (1978) 
2 SCC 213.  

variables, - may be a little surp lus is left over at the end of the year – the broad 
inhibition against making profit is a good guarantee that the carrying on of the 
activity is not for profit ”. 
171. Therefore, pure charity in the sense that the performance of an activity 
without any consideration  is not envisioned under the Act. If one keeps this in 
mind, what Section 2(15) emphasizes is that so long as a GPU’s charity’s object 
involves activities whi ch also generates profits ( incidental , or in other words, 
while actually  carrying  out the objectives of GPU, if some profit is generated), it 
can be granted  exemption provided the quantitative limit  (of not exceeding 20%)  
under second proviso to Section 2( 15) for receipts from such profits, is adhered 
to. 
172. Yet another manner of looking at the definition together with Sections  
10(23) and 11 is that for achieving a general public utility object, if the charity 
involves itself in activities, that entail ch arging amounts only at cost or marginal 
mark up over cost, and also derive some profit , the prohibition against carrying 
on business or service relating to business is not attracted  - if the quantum of such 
profits do not exceed 20% of its overall receipts . 
173. It may be useful to conclude this section on interpretation with some 
illustrations. The example of Gandhi Peace Foundation disseminating Mahatma 
Gandhi’s philosophy (in Surat Art Silk ) through museums and exhibitions and 
publishing his works, for n ominal cost, ipso facto is not business. Likewise, 
providing access to low -cost hostels to weaker segments of society, where the fee 
or charges recovered cover the costs  (including administrative expenditure)  plus 
nominal mark up ; or renting marriage halls for low amounts, again with a fee 
meant to cover costs ; or blood bank services, again with fee to cover costs, are 
not activities in the nature of business. Yet, when the entity concerned charges 
substantial amounts - over and abo ve the cost it incurs  for doing the same work, 
or work which is part of its object (i.e. , publishing an expensive coffee table book 

on Gandhi , or in the case of the marriage hall, charging significant amounts from 
those who can afford to pay, by providing extra services, far above the cost-plus 
nominal markup) such activities are in the nature of trade, commerce, business or 
service in relation to them.  In such case, the receipts from such latter kind of 
activities where higher amounts are charged, should n ot exceed the limit indicated 
by proviso (ii) to Section 2(15).  
174. The insertion of Section 13(8)144, the seventeenth proviso to Section 
10(23C) and third proviso to Section 143(3) (all of which were inserted by 
Finance Act, 2012, but w.r.e.f. 01.04.2009 ), further reinforces the interpretation 
of this Court, of “charitable purpose”. These provisions, form the machinery to 
control the conditions under which income is exempt. The effect of the 
seventeenth proviso to Section 10(23C) is to impose the same condition i.e. , that 
that the trade, commerce or business activity or service relating to trade, business 
or commerce, should be part of the GPU’s activities, to achieve its object of 
advancing general public utility.  The other condition – which is drawn i n as part 
of the exemption condition, is that if such trading or commercial activity takes 
place the receipts should be confined to a prescribed percentage of the overall 
receipts. Section 13(8) too reinforces the same condition.   
175. In the opinion of t his court, the change intended by Parliament through the 
amendment of Section 2(15) was sought to be emphasised and clarified by the 
amendment of Section 10(23C) and the insertion of Section 13(8). This was 
Parliaments’ emphatic way of saying that generall y no commercial or business or 
trading activity ought to be engaged by GPU charities but that in the course of 
their functioning of carrying out activities of general public utility, they can in a 
limited manner do so, provided the receipts are within the limit spelt out in Clause 
(ii) of the proviso to Section 2(15).  
 
144 “(8) Nothing contained in section 11 or section 12 shall operate so as to exclude any income from the total 
income of the previous year of the person in receipt thereof if the provisions of the first proviso to clause (15) of 
section 2 become applicable in the case of such person in the said previous year.”  

 
D. What kinds of income or receipts may not be characterized as derived 
from trade, commerce , business  or in relation to such activities,  for a 
consideration  
(i) Statutory corporations , authorities or bodies   
176. It would be essential now to deal with certain kinds of receipts which GPU 
charities, typically statutory housing boards, regulatory authorities and 
corporations may be entitled to, if mandated to collect or receive. During the 
course of h earing, learned counsel s highlighted that statutory boards, and 
corporations have to recover the cost of providing essential goods and services in 
public interest, and also fund large scale development and maintain public 
property. These would entail recov ering charges or fees, interest and also 
receiving interest for holding deposits. It was further pointed out that in some 
cases, income in the form of rents – having regard to the nature of the schemes 
which the concerned board, trust or corporation may be  mandated or permitted to 
carry on , has to be received. For instance, in some situations, for certain kinds of 
properties, the boards may be permitted only to lease out their assets and receive 
rents.  
177. The answers to these, in the opinion of this court, are that the definition 
ipso facto does not spell out whether certain kinds of income can be excluded. 
However, the reference to specific provisions enabling or mandating collection 
of certain rates, tari ffs or costs would have to be examined. Generically , going by  
statutory models in enactments (under which  corporations boards or trust or 
authority by whatsoever name, are set up), the mere fact that these bodies have to 
charge amounts towards supplying g oods or articles, or rendering services i.e. , 
for fees for providing typical essential services like providing water, distribution 
of food  grains, distribution of medicines, maintenance of roads, parks etc. , ought 
not to be characterized as “commercial rec eipts” . The rationale  for such 
exclusion would be that if such rates, fees, tariffs , etc., determined by statutes and 

collected for essential services, are included in the overall income as receipts as 
part of trade, commerce or business , the quantitative limit of 20% imposed by 
second proviso to Section 2(15) would be attracted thereby negating the essential 
general public utility object and thus driving up the costs to be borne by the 
ultimate user  or consumer which is the general public. By way of illus tration, if 
a corporation supplies essential food  grains at cost, or a marginal mark up, another 
supplies essential medicines, and a third, water, the characterization of these, as 
activities in the nature of business, would be self -defeating, because the overall 
receipts in some given cases may exceed the quantitative limit resulting in 
taxation and the consequent higher consideration charged from the user or 
consumer.  
(a) Interpretation of Section 10(46) and Section 2(15)  
178. Section (20A) was inserted by Fi nance Act, 1970 with effect from 
01.04.1962. It had excluded certain  classes of income, of corporations145. This 
court had occasion to deal with the provision while it was in force in the GIDC 
case (supra) . The court had then emphasized that the expression “development” 
in Section 10(20A) should be understood widely; thus, all development 
programmes “relating to any industry” fell within the purview of “development”. 
The court also highlighted that nothing in the IT Act laid down how a corporation 
could be termed as a development corporation nor was there anything mandating 
that fee chargeable by such corporations was confined to non -industrial activities.  
179. The decision in Gujarat Maritime Board case (supra) was rendered in the 
context of Section 10(20). That provision exempts income accruing to local 
authorities, from taxation. By Finance Act, 2002, an Explanation was added to 
 
145 Incomes not included in total income.  
10. In computing the total income of a previous year of any person, any income falling within any of the fo llowing 
clauses shall not be included - 
xxxxxx    xxxxxx    xxxxxx  
 (20A) any income of an authority constituted in India by or under any law enacted either for the purpose of 
dealing with and satisfying the need for housing accommodation or for the purpose o f planning, development or 
improvement  of cities, towns and villages, or for both.  

Section 10(20) which defined “local authority” retrospectively. The Board ceas ed 
to enjoy exemption which it had hitherto, in the absence of the retrospective 
definition. It, therefore sought exemption, as a GPU category charity claiming 
that it was controlled by objects of general public utility having regard to the 
provisions of i ts parent Act, i.e. , the Gujarat Maritime Board Act. This court 
refuted the argument of the revenue that if a corporation did not fall within the 
definition of “local authority” it could not claim to be a GPU charity. It was held 
that Section 10(20) and Se ction 11 of the 1961 Act operate in totally different 
spheres. Even if the Board is not considered as a local authority, it is not precluded 
from claiming exemption under Section 11(1) of the 1961 Act. Therefore, the 
court read Section 11(1) in light of th e definition of the words “charitable 
purposes” as defined under Section 2(15). This court also relied upon the ruling 
in CIT v. APSRTC (supra) where the APSRTC – constituted under the Road 
Transport Corporation Act, 1950 – having regard to the objectives of the Act, was 
held to be a GPU charity , thus entitling it to exemption in terms of the IT Act.  
180. In the light of these decisions, it is evident that the revenue’s narrow 
construction by which tax exemption is denied on the ground that if an entity is  
not covered by Section 10(20 A) – or the newly applicable Section 10(46), it 
cannot claim benefit as a GPU charity under Section 11, is unsound. These two 
provisions confer different though overlapping benefits. If an entity does not fulfil 
the requirement of one provision because it does not answer the descripti on of a 
body under that provision, that ipso facto  is not a bar for it to claim benefit of 
another provision.  
181. Section 10(46) re -incarnated so to say Section 10(20A) , which had been 
deleted w.e.f.  01.04.2003. This provision, i.e. , Section 10(46) was inserted with 
effect from 01.04.2009 retrospectively  by the Finance Act, 2011146. The 
 
146 Incomes not included in total income.  
10. In computing the total income of a previous year of any person, any income falling within any of the following 
clauses shall not  be included - 
 

conditions for applicability of Section 10(46), i.e. , that specified income or a class 
of specified income of ports, trusts or commissions , etc., established or 
constituted by or under Central or State enactments with the object of regulating 
or administering any activity in the general public , is on similar lines as in the 
case of GPU charities. Like in the case of GPU charities, there is a prohibition by 
Section 10(46)( b) against such corporations , etc. engaging in commercial 
activity. This restriction has been introduced for the first time [as that prohibition 
was absent in the now repealed Section 10 (20A)] . 
182. The term “commercial” is closely similar to, if not identical, with the 
phrase “in the nature of trade, commerce or business.”  The other condition in  
Section 10(46) is that the specified income to be exempted , is to be notified by 
the Central Government in the Official Gazette. Facially  the allusion to 
commercial activity, appears to be in the nature of a complete bar to activities 
which are akin to commerce or business, yielding profit. However, what needs to 
be kept in mind is that the object of Section 10 is to remove from the taxable net, 
an entire class of receipts of income. Given this object of Section 10 , the 
interpretation of “commercial” activity has to be on the same lines as in the case 
of income derived  by GPU charities, in the course of their actual functioning, by 
involving in activities in the nature of trade, commerce or business. Thus, if 
statutory corporations within Section 10(46) derive their income by charging a 
nominal mark -up over the cost of service rendered or goods supplied, meant to 
recover the costs of the activities they engage in primarily or to achieve the object 
for which they were set up, such as development of housing, road infrastructure, 
 
xxxxxx    xxxxxx    xxxxxx  
 
(46) any specified income arising to a body or authority or Board or Trust or Commission (by whatever name 
called) or a class, thereof which - 
(a) has been established or constituted by or under a Central, State or Pr ovincial Act, or constituted by the Central 
Government or a State Government, with the object of regulating or administering any activity for the benefit of 
the general public;  
(b) is not engaged in any commercial activity; and  
(c) is notified by the Centr al Government in the Official Gazette for the purposes of this clause.  

water supply, sewage treatment, supply of fo od grains, medicines, etc ., with or 
without regulatory powers, the mere fact that some surplus or gain is derived 
would not disentitle them from the benefit of Section 10(46).  
183. In this context, it would be useful to consider the judgment of the Delhi 
and Allahabad High Court s in Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority 
v. Union of India147 (hereafter “GNIDA ”) and CIT v. Yamuna Expressway 
Industrial Development Authority148. In GNIDA (supra), the High Court drew a 
distinction between bodies set up by the government with commercial purpose 
and objects – which are motivated by profit , and other government bodies. The 
court held , correctly so – that other government bodies are not entitled to 
exemption as they are motivated by profit. Then, dealing wit h the term 
“commercial activity” under Section 10(46), it was held that the decisive test is 
whether the activities for which consideration in the form of fee, service charge 
etc., is collected, is “ intrinsically associated, connected and had minimum nexus  
with the object of regulating and administering the activity for the benefit of the 
public ”.  
184. It was also held that if the activity is not carried on commercial lines, i.e. , 
with the profit motive in mind , but the body is assigned an administrative r ole, 
having regard to the objects of the controlling statute or law, exemption cannot 
be denied under Section 10(46). As juxtaposed , activities for profit or activities 
which clearly were motivated by profit – carried on by government or statutory 
bodies, cannot avail of exemption. The judgment in Yamuna Industrial 
Development Authority  (supra) is along the similar lines.  
185. As far as boards and corporations which are tasked with development of 
industrial areas , by statute, the judgments of this court, in Shri Ramtanu 
Cooperative Housing Society (supra) and Gujarat Industrial Development

Corporation (supra) have declared that these bodies are involved in 
‘development ’ and are not essentially engaged in trading. In Shri Ramtanu 
Cooperative Housing Society  (supra) this court, by a five judge bench, held that 
the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation is not a trading concern, 
and observed as follows:  
“These features of transfer of land, or borrowing of moneys or receipt of rents 
and profits will by themselves neither be the indicia nor the decisive attributes 
of the trading character of the Corporation. Ordinarily, a Corporation is 
established by shareholders with their capital. The shareholders have their 
Directors for the regulation and manageme nt of the Corporation Such a 
Corporation set up by the shareholders carries on business and is intended 
for making profits. When profits are earned by such a Corporation they are 
distributed to shareholders by way of dividends or kept in reserve funds. In 
the present case, these attributes of a trading Corporation are absent. The 
Corporation is established by the Act for carrying out the purposes of the Act. 
The purposes of the Act are development of industries in the State. The 
Corporation consists of nomi nees of the State Government, State Electricity 
Board and the Housing Board. The functions and powers of the Corporation 
indicate that the Corporation is acting as a wing of the State Government in 
establishing industrial estates and developing industrial areas, acquiring 
property for those purposes, constructing buildings, allotting buildings, 
factory sheds to industrialists or industrial undertakings. It is obvious that the 
Corporation will receive moneys for disposal of land, buildings and other 
properti es and also that the Corporation would receive rents and profits in 
appropriate cases. Receipts of these moneys arise not out of any business or 
trade but out of sole purpose of establishment, growth and development of 
industries.  
17. The Corporation has t o provide amenities and facilities in industrial 
estates and industrial areas. Amenities of road, electricity, sewerage and 
other facilities in industrial estates and industrial areas are within the 
programme of work of the Corporation. The found of the Co rporation consists 
of moneys received from the State Government, all fees, costs and charges 
received by the Corporation, all moneys received by the Corporation from 
the disposal of lands, buildings and other properties and all moneys received 
by the Corpo ration by way of rents and profits or in any other manner. The 
Corporation shall have the authority to spend such sums out of the general 
funds of the Corporation or from reserve and other funds. The Corporation 
is to make provision for reserve and other s pecially denominated funds as the 
State Government may direct. The Corporation accepts deposits from 
persons, authorities or institutions to whom allotment or sale of land, 
buildings, or sheds is made or is likely to be made in furtherance of the object 
of the Act. A budget is prepared showing the estimated receipts and 
expenditure. The accounts of the Corporation are audited by an auditor 
appointed by the State Government. These provisions in regard to the finance 
of the Corporation indicate the real role of the Corporation viz. the agency 
of the Government in carrying out the purpose and object of the Act which is 

the development of industries. If in the ultimate analysis there is excess of 
income over expenditure that will not establish the trading charac ter of the 
Corporation. There are various departments of the Government which may 
have excess of income over expenditure.  
**************     ********   *********  
20. The underlying concept of a trading Corporation is buying and selling. 
There is no aspect of  buying or selling by the Corporation in the present case. 
The Corporation carries out the purposes of the Act, namely, development of 
industries in this State. The construction of buildings, the establishment of 
industries by letting buildings on hire or sale, the acquisition and transfer of 
land in relation to establishment of industrial estate or development of 
industrial areas and of setting up of industries cannot be said to be dealing 
in land or buildings for the obvious reason that the State is carry ing out the 
objects of the Act with the Corporation as an agent in setting up industries in 
the State. The Act aims at building an industrial town and the Corporation 
carries out the objects of the Act. The hard core of a trading Corporation is 
its commerc ial character. Commerce connotes transactions of purchase and 
sale of commodities, dealing in goods. The forms of business transactions 
may be varied but the real character is buying and selling. The true character 
of the Corporation in the present case is  to act as an architectural agent of 
the development and growth of industrial towns by establishing and 
developing industrial estates and industrial areas. We are of opinion that the 
Corporation is not a trading one.”  
 
186. In Shri Ramtanu Cooperative Hous ing Society (supra) no doubt, this court 
did not have to decide whether the Maharashtra Industrial Development 
Corporation was entitled to tax exemption. However, it examined the provisions 
of the Act, and the ratio, that such industrial development corpor ations are not 
engaged in trading, is binding. Like in that case, here too, the concerned state 
Acts (Gujarat Industrial Development Act, 1962 and the Karnataka Industrial 
Areas Development Act, 1966) tasked  the boards  with planning and development 
of indu strial areas. Their personnel are appointed under the enactment s and are 
deemed to be public servants. The state government is empowered to acquire 
land, in exercise of eminent domain power, for their purposes; their audits are by 
the Accountant General of  the concerned state,  or auditors appointed by the state. 
They a re authorized by law, to levy rates and charges, for the services they 
provide, on pre -determined basis. In the light of these provisions, clearly, these 
boards and authorities perform objects of general public utility; and they are not 
driven by profit mo tive.  

187. There is a two -fold distinction between the now -deleted Section 10(20A) 
and the newly added Section 10(46) (w.e.f. 01.06.2011) . Firstly, that the erstwhile 
Section 10(20A) applied to a limited class of undertaking i.e., the bodies, or 
corporations, constituted by or under any law -confined to the planning and 
development of housing infrastructure.  However, the newly added Section 
10(46) is wider in comparison and the activities of any body or authority or board 
constituted by or under any central or State Act with “ the object of regulating or 
administering any activity for the benefit of the general public ”, has broader 
import. In a sense, t he newly added Section 10(46), resembles a GPU category 
charity classified under Section 2(15).  The second distinction is that Section 
10(20A) did not bar any board, or corporations , etc. from indulging in commercial 
activities. However, sub -clause (b) of  Section 10(46) imposes such a bar, and the 
concerned body cannot claim tax exemption if it engages in commercial activity.   
188. The manner in which GPU charities has been dealt with under the 
definition clause, i.e., Section 2(15), indicates that even t hough trading or 
commercial activity or service in relation to trade, commerce or business appears 
to be barred  – nevertheless the ban is lifted somewhat by the proviso which 
enables such activities to be carried out if they are intrinsically  part of the a ctivity 
of achieving the object of general public utility.  Furthermore, in the case of GPU 
charities there is a quantified limit of the overall receipts, which is permissible 
from such commercial activity.  In the case of local authorities and corporation s 
covered by Section 10(46) no such activities are seemingly permitted.  
189. As was observed in the earlier part of this judgment – while considering 
whether for the period 01.0.2003 - 31.05.2011, statutory boards, corporations , etc. 
could have lawfully c laimed to be GPU charities, this court has observed that the 
nature of such corporations is not to generate profit but to make available goods 
and other services for the benefit of public weal. If such corporations (falling 
within the description of Sectio n 10(46)) applied to the Central Government for 

exemption, the treatment of their receipts, should be no different than how such 
receipts can and should have been treated for the purposes of determining whether 
they are GPU charities, during the period whe n Section 10(46) was not in 
existence. Furthermore, this court is of the opinion that having regard to the 
observations in Gujarat Maritime Board  case (supra),  the denial of exemption 
under one category cannot debar such corporations from claiming income exempt 
status under another category.  
(b) Summary in relation to statutory authorities/corporations  
190. In light of the above discussion, this court is of the opinion that:  
(i) The fact that bodies which carry on statutory functions whose income 
was eligi ble to be considered for exemption under Section 10(20A) 
ceased to enjoy that benefit after deletion of that provision w.e.f.  
01.04.2003, does not ipso facto  preclude their claim for consideration 
for benefit as GPU category charities , under Section 11 read with  
Section 2(15)  of the Act . 
(ii) Statutory Corporations, Boards, Authorities, Commissions , etc. (by 
whatsoever names called) in the housing development, town planning, 
industrial development sectors are involved in the advancement of 
objects of general pub lic utility , therefore are entitled to be considered  
as charities in the GPU categories.  
(iii) Such statutory corporations, boards, trusts authorities, etc. may be 
involved in promoting public objects and also in the course of their 
pursuing their objec ts, involved or engaged in activities in the nature of 
trade , commerce or business .  
(iv) The determina tive tests to consider when determining whether such 
statutory bodies, boards, authorities, corporations, autonomous or self -
governing government sponsored bodies, are GPU category charities:  

(a) Does the state or central law , or the memorandum of association,  
constitution , etc. advance any GPU  object , such as development of 
housing,  town planning, development of industrial areas, or 
regulation of any activity in the general public interest, supply of 
essential goods or services  - such as water supply, sewage s ervice, 
distributing medicines, of food  grains (PDS entities), etc .; 
(b)  While carrying on of such activities to achieve such objects ( which 
are to be discerned from the objects and policy of the enactment; or 
in terms of the controlling instrument, such as memorandum of 
association etc.), the purpose for which such public GPU charity, is 
set-up - whether for furthering the development or a charitable 
object or for carrying on trade, business or commerce or service in 
relation to such trad e, etc.; 
(c) Rendition of service  or providing any article or goods,  by such 
boards, authority, corporation , etc., on cost or nominal mark -up 
basis would ipso facto not be activities in the nature of business, 
trade or commerce or service in relation to such business, trade or 
commerce ; 
(d) where the controlling instrument, particularly a statute imposes 
certain responsibilities or duties upon the concerned body, such as 
fixation of rates on pre -determined statutory basis, or based on 
formulae regulated by law, or  rules having the force of law, setting 
apart amenities for the purposes of development, charging fixed 
rates towards supply of water, providing sewage services, providing 
food-grains, medicines, and/or retaining monies in deposits or 
government securities  and drawing interest therefrom or charging 
lease rent, ground rent , etc., per se , recovery of such charges, fee, 
interest ,  etc. cannot be characterized as “fee, cess or other 
consideration”  for engaging in activities in the nature of trade, 

commerce, or business , or for providing service in relation in 
relation thereto ; 
(e)  Does the statute or controlling instrument set out the policy or 
scheme, for how the goods and services are to be distributed; in what 
proportion the surpluses, or profits, can be permiss ively garnered;  
are there are limits within which plots, rates or costs are to be worked 
out; whether the function in which the body is engaged in, is 
normally something a government or state is expected to engage in, 
having regard to provisions of the Co nstitution and the enacted laws, 
and the observations of this court in NDMC ; whether in case surplus 
or gains accrue, the corporation, body or authority is permitted to 
distribute it, and if so, only to the government or state; the extent to 
which the stat e or its instrumentalities have control over the 
corporation or its bodies, and whether it is subject to directions by 
the concerned government, etc. ; 
(f) As long as the concerned statutory body, corporation, authority , etc. 
while actually furthering a GPU obj ect, carri es out activities  that 
entail some trade, commerce or business , which generate s profit 
(i.e., amounts that are significantly higher than the cost), and the 
quantum of such receipts are within the prescribed limit (20% as 
mandated by the second pr oviso to Section 2(15) ) – the concerned 
statutory or government organisation s can be characterized as GPU 
charities. It goes without saying that the other conditions imposed 
by the seventh proviso to Section 10(23C) and by Section 11 have 
to necessarily be  fulfilled.  
(v) As a consequence, it is necessary in each case, having regard to the first 
proviso and seventeenth proviso (the latter introduced in 2012, w.r.e.f 
01.04.2009 ) to Section 10(23C) , that  the authority considering  granting 
exemption, take s into acc ount the objects of the enactment or 

instrument concerned, its underlying policy, and the nature of the 
functions , and activities , of the entity claiming to be a GPU charity. If 
in the course of its functioning it collects fees, or any consideration that 
merely  cover its expenditure (including administrative and other costs 
plus a small proportion for provision)  - such amounts are not 
consideration towards trade, commerce or business, or service in 
relation thereto. However, amounts which are signific antly higher than 
recovery of costs, have to be treated as receipts from trade, commerce 
or business. It is for those amounts, that the quantitative limit in proviso 
(ii) to Section 2(15) applies, and for which separate books of account 
will have to be mai ntained under other provisions of the IT Act.  
(ii) Statutory r egulatory bodies/authorities   
191. During the hearings, rival contentions were made in regard to the facial 
nature of the public utility character of regulatory bodies. A sample special case 
was th at of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). In respect of 
some years, the revenue has preferred appeals and in respect of some others, the 
Institute has preferred appeals. Reliance was placed upon the provisions of the 
ICAI Act  and detail ed submissions were made  to emphasise that it plays a pivotal 
role in regulating the entire universe of vocation of Chartered Accountants – i.e., 
selecting candidates that can undergo the educational course, setting the syllabus 
for the Chartered Accountan cy examination; holding classes, training sessions 
and imparting education ; conducting exams , etc. It was  highlighted that the 
membership of the institute, i.e. , those who are enrolled as Chartered Accounts 
has grown significantly. Whereas in the end of financial year 2005, the 
membership was 1.23 lakhs, it had increased to 1,86,440 on 31.03.2012.  
Likewise, there was an exponential growth in the students appearing  in the 
examination - in 2005, it was 2,96,294, and on 31.03.2012, it had increased to 
10,70,839. Apparently, the Institute conducts distance education courses and also 

conducts classroom instruction facilities. These are integrated with the course 
curricu lum. Additionally , it was urged that no commercial motive was involved; 
coaching and revisional classes conducted are very nominal ly priced  - ranging 
from ₹1500 to ₹2500 for one group , and from ₹4000 to ₹6000 for both groups, 
depending on cities where the classes are held.  
192. During the submissions on behalf of the Institute, the financials for 
different years were provided. It was revealed that the total outflow towards 
salaries for 2003 -04 was ₹55.27 lakhs and depreciation f or the same was ₹51.64 
lakhs.  The total expenditure for that year was ₹1.0691 lakhs. As against that, the 
Revenue earned from generation of fees for the corresponding year which was 
₹1.78 crores and the corresponding expenditure was ₹96.93 lakhs. The 
corresponding figures for FY 2011 -12 for salaries was ₹2.94 crores. The 
depreciation was Rs.4.05 crores. The total expenditure thus was ₹ 6.9 crores. As 
against this, the amount received towards fees was ₹6.36 crores and expenditure 
incurred towards coaching, including salaries , provisions  of course material , etc. 
was ₹4.34 crores. The surplus (without including administrative expenditure ) for 
that year was ₹2.01 crores. The Institute apparently cannot distribute the surplus 
or utilise it for any activity other than what is set out under th e controlling statute 
and its rules.  
193. The Revenue highlighted  that conducting courses leading to a professional 
qualification and charging fees  for it is in the nature of a ‘service ’, and all services  
in relation to trade, commerce or business squarely falls within the mischief of 
Section 2(15) , which has to preclude the institute’s claim for exemption as a GPU 
charity.  
194. The Institute is a creature of the Institute of Chartered Accountants Act, 
1949. By Section 4 of this Act, every person who qualifies in the examination 
conducted by the Institute has to seek registration as a Chartered Accountant. 
Only when members obtain certificates issued by the Council of the Institute 

under Section 6 can they  be known as a ‘Chartered Accountant ’ and be entitled 
to practice that profession (Sections 6 and 7). The Council of the Institute is 
constituted under Section 9 which defines such constitution and the manner for 
holding elections , etc. The functions of th e Council by Section 15(2A) include 
approving the academic courses and their contents, examining the candidates, 
regulation and articleship assistance, prescribing qualification for entry of 
persons in the register, collection of fees from members; the reg ulation and 
maintenance and status of the professional qualifications of the members of the 
Institute , etc. By Section 15A, universities  are enabled to impart education on 
subjects covered by the academic courses of the Institute. However, by Section 
15A(2 ) while awarding degrees or diplomas, their designation should not 
resemble or be identical to what is awarded by the Institute. The finances are 
regulated by Section 18. The Council is enjoined to maintain the register under 
Section 19 and has disciplinary powers by virtue of Section 21A, 21B and 21C 
of the Act.  
195. These provisions of the Act clarify beyond a doubt that the Institute 
performs statutory functions in the larger public interest of regulating the 
standards of education, leading up  to the profession of C hartered Accountancy  
and also prescribing standards of professional etiquette , behaviour , and discipline 
of its members. No other entity or body has the authority in law to perform the 
functions that the Institute does. Although the Act regulating Chartered 
Accountancy came into force prior to the Constitution of India , the subject (of 
regulating professions , etc.) appears to be relatable to the exercise of legislative 
power under Entry 25 and 26 of the Concurrent List149. Furthermore,  they also 
 
149 In List III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India,  
“25. Education, including technical education, medical education and universities, subject to the provisions of 
entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I; vocational and technical training of la bour.  
26. Legal, medical and other professions” . 

appear to conform to Entry 65 of the Union List150 (which has been adverted to 
in Entry 25 of the Concurrent List ). As things stand, the Institute is the only body 
which prescribes the contents of professional education and entirely regulates the  
profession of Chartered Accountancy. There is no other body authorised to 
perform any other duties which it performs. It, therefore, clearly falls in the 
description of a charity advancing general public utility . Having regard to the 
previous discussion o n the nature of charities and what constitutes activities in 
the ‘nature of trade, business or commerce ’, the functions of the Institute ipso 
facto does not fall within the description of such ‘prohibited activities ’. The fees 
charged by the Institute and the manner of its utilisation are entirely controlled 
by law. Furthermore, the material on record shows that the amounts received by 
it are not towards providing any commercial service or business but are essential 
for the providing of service to the socie ty and the general public.  
196. Similarly, there are several other regulatory bodies that discharge functions 
which are otherwise within the domain of the State. A singular characterist ic of 
ICAI and other statutory bodies which can be said to regulate  specific functions 
and professions (including the profession of Cost and Work Accountants , and 
Company Secretary , etc.) is the powers conferred upon them by the statutes to 
prescribe standards and enforce them through disciplinary sanctions. There fore, 
it is held that bodies which regulate professions and are created by or under 
statute s which are enjoined to prescribe compulsory courses to be undergone 
before the individuals concerned is entitled to claim entry into the profession or 
vocation , and also continuously monitor the conduct of its members do not ipso 
facto  carry on activities in the nature of trade, commerce or business, or services 
in relation thereto . 
 
150 In List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India,  
“65. Union agencies and institutions for —  
(a) professional, vocational or technical training, including the training of police officers; or  
(b) the promotion of special studies or research; or  
(c) scientific or technical assistance in the investigation or detection  
of crime.”  

197. At the same time, this court would sound a note of caution. It is important, 
at times, while considering the nature of activities (which may be part of a 
statutory mandate) that regulatory bodies may perform, whether the kind of 
consideration charged is vastly or significantly higher than the costs it incurs. For 
instance, there can b e in given situations, regulatory fees which may have to be 
paid annually, or the body may require candidates, or professionals to purchase 
and fill forms, for entry into the profession, or towards examinations. If the level 
of such fees or collection towa rds forms, brochures, or exams are significantly 
higher than the cost, such income would attract the mischief of proviso to Section 
2(15), and would have to be within the limits prescribed by sub -clause (ii) of the 
proviso to Section 2(15).   
198. The next  set of ‘statutory regulatory authorities’ a mong the present batch 
are those related to authorities set up under the Seeds Act, 1966 (i.e , the Andhra 
Pradesh State Seeds Certification Authority and the Rajasthan State Seeds and 
Organic Production certifica tion Agency). These two entities are set up as 
societies under Section 8 of the Seeds Act, and comprise of farmers, farmers co -
operatives’ representatives, seed certification authorities, etc. The task of these 
agencies and authorities is certification of seeds, to decide whether to certify 
supply  of seeds of  “any notified kind or variety”, by applicants who may wish to 
offer them for trade. These agencies/authorities scrutinize the samples to ensure 
they conform to the requisite standard notified under Se ction 6. These decisions  
are subject to appeal under Section 11.   
199. The functioning of the seed certification agency, is a crucial one, in those 
only seeds conforming to prescribed standards, are permitted to be traded and 
used, by farmers. Such standards are - in the context of the fact that agriculture is 
one of the main stays of the economy, and furthermore, pivotal for food security 
- essential as they ensure efficacy of seeds and guarantee to the farmers that they 
can be relied upon. The essential nature of the regulatory function performed by 

these certification agenci es is obvious. The nature of their activities is not by way 
of trade, commerce or business, nor service in relation to trade commerce, 
business, for some form of consideration.  
 
(iii) Trade Promotion bodies, councils, associations or organizations  
200. Surat Art  Silk (supra)  and other decisions, had ruled that as long as the 
objects of trade promotion bodies were for general public utility - wherein ‘ trade 
promotion ’ in itself, was held to be a GPU  - the fact that incidentally these bodies 
carried on some  commerc ial activity, leading to profit, did not preclude them from 
claiming to be driven by charitable purpose. As observed earlier, the enunciation 
of those principles were in the context of the unamended  Section 2(15).  
201. The question that arises is whether the change in definition impact s the 
claims of  trade promotion bodies, federations of commerce, or such 
organizations , that they are GPU charities . The judgment in Surat Art Silk (supra) 
proceeded on the assumption that trade promot ion was the pre -dominant object 
of the GPU charity before the court, and that other objects – including procuring 
licences, trade etc . were incidental. The assessee in Surat Silk had clear trading 
objects:  
“(b) To carry on all and any of the business of Ar t Silk Yarn, Raw Silk, 
Cotton Yarn as well as Art Silk f loth, Silk Cloth and Cotton Cloth 
belonging to and on behalf of the members.  
*********      **********  
(e) To buy and sell and deal in all kinds of cloth and other goods and 
fabrics belonging to and o n behalf of the Members.”  
This court, nevertheless , held that since the predominant object of the assessee 
was trade promotion , while furthering it, the fact that some trading occurred, 
leading to income, did not preclude the assessee from claiming tax exemption.  
202. In the opinion of this court, the change in definition in Section 2(15) and 
the negative phraseology  - excluding from consideration , trusts or institutions 
which provide services in relation to trade, commerce or business, for fee or other 

consideration  - has made a difference. Organizing meetings, disseminating 
information through publications, holding awareness camps and events, would be 
broadly covered by trade promotion. However, when a trade promotion body 
provides individualized or spe cialized services  - such as conducting paid 
workshops, training courses, skill development courses certified by it, and hires 
venues which are then let out to industrial, trading or business organizations, to 
promote and advertise their respective business es, the claim for GPU status needs 
to be scrutinised more closely. Such activities are in the nature of services “ in 
relation  to” trade, commerce or business. The se activities,  and the facility of 
consultation, or skill development courses, are meant to im prove business 
activities, and make them more efficient. The receipts from such activities clearly 
are ‘fee or other consideration ’ for providing service “ in relation to ” trade, 
commerce or business.  
203. The revenue has appealed to this court, in respect  of two assessment years, 
in the case of Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC). The objects of AEPC , 
which was set up in 1978 – include promotion of ready -made garment export. To 
achieve that end, its objects include providing training  to instil  skills  in the 
workforce,  to improve  skills  in the industry;  guide  in sourcing  machinery;  to serve  
as a body  advising,  providing  information  on market  or technical  intelligence ; 
assist ing the concerned  industry  in obtaining  import  licenses ; showcase  the best 
capabilities  of Indian  garment  exports  through  the prestigious  “India  International  
Garment  Fair”  organised  twice  a year by AEPC , etc. These  fairs host over 350 
participants  who exhibi t their garment  designs  and patterns.  Other  functions  are 
to provide  information,  and to provide  market  research.  AEPC  also assists  in 
developing  new design  patterns  and garments  and to perform  promotional  
activities  in individual  foreign  markets.  Further,  AEPC  sends  missions  and trade  
delegations  abroad , who participate  in international  fairs;  and conducts  surveys  
to gather  information  on potential  export  of ready -made  garments.   

204. As part of its functioning, it also books bulk space, which is then rent ed 
out to individual Indian exporters, who showcase their products and services, and 
ultimately secure export orders. Towards these services, i.e. , booking and 
providing space, AEPC charges rentals. Now, these rents are not towards fixed 
assets owned by it . They are in fact charges, or fees , towards services in relation  
to business; likewise, the skill development and diploma courses conducted by it, 
for which fees are charged, are to improve business functioning of garment 
exporters. Furthermore, market su rveys and market intelligence, especially 
country specific activities, aimed at catering to specified exporters, or specified 
class of exporters, is also service in relation to trade, commerce or business.  
205. In the circumstances, it cannot be said that  AEPC’s functioning does not 
involve any element of trade, commerce or business, or service in relation thereto . 
Though in some instances, the recipient may be an individual business house or 
exporter, there is no doubt  that these activities, performed by a trade body  
continue to be trade promotion . Therefore, they are in the “ actual course of 
carrying on ” the GPU activity. In such a case, for each year, the question would 
be whether the quantum from these receipts, and other such receipts are within 
the li mit prescribed by the sub -clause (ii) to proviso to Section 2(15). If they are 
within the limits, AEPC would be – for that year, entitled to claim benefit as a 
GPU charity.  
 
(iv) Non-statutory bodies - ERNET, NIXI and GS1  India  
206. ERNET is a not -for profit society, set up under the aegis of the Union 
Government. At one time, government functionaries, including the late President, 
APJ Abdul Kalam, were members, on account of their ex offic io capacity. The 
objects of this assessee are  to  
“ 3.1.1 To advance the cause of computer communication in the country in 
all its aspects and dimensions with a view to provide rapid nationwide 

development of the sector and technological and economic growth of the 
county.  
3.1.2 To develop, design, se tup and operate nationwide state of the art 
computer communication infrastructure with international connectivity 
directed towards research and development, advancement of high quality 
education, create and host content, express creative and academic poten tial 
via intranet and intranet peer to peer connectivity among educational and 
research institutions in the country and the world and make available the 
communication infrastructure to users in academic, research and 
development institutions, Govt organiza tions in line with national 
priorities.”  
207. ERNET’s networks are a mix of terrestrial and satellite -based wide -area 
network. It provides services through its 15 Points of Presence (PoPs ) located 
across the country. All those are equipped to provide access to Intranet, Internet 
and Digital Library through trial leased circuits and radio links to the user 
institutions. The PoP at STPI Bengaluru provides Intranet and Internet access 
through  Satellite.  ERNET provides, services, namely, Network Access Services, 
Network Applications Services, Hosting Services, Operations Support Services 
und Domain Registration Services under srnet.in, ac.in, edu.in & res.in domains. 
Funded through government g rants, its projects support educational networks and 
development of internet infrastructure in numerous other segments of society .  
208. Having regard to the nature of ERNET’s activities, it cannot be said that 
they are in the nature of trade, commerce or business, or service, towards trade, 
commerce or business. It has to receive fee s, to reimburse its costs. The materials 
on record nowhere suggest that its receipts (in the nature of membership fee, 
connectivity charges , data transfer differential charges , and registration charges) 
are of such nature as to be called as fees or consideration towards  business, trade 
or commerce, or service in relation to it. The functions ERNET pe rforms are vital 
to the development of online educational and research platforms . For these 
reasons, it is held that the impugned judgment, which upheld the ITAT’s order, 
does not call for interference .  

209. The Revenue has appealed the decision of Delhi High Court in which the 
National Internet Exchange of India (NIXI) was held to b e a GPU category 
charity. The materials on record show that NIXI was established in 2003 under 
the aegis of the Ministry of Information Technology of the Union Government 
for the promotion and growth of internet services in India , to regulate the internet 
traffic , act as an internet exchange , and undertake “.in” domain name registration . 
Concededly, NIXI, is a not for profit, and is barred from undertaking any 
commercial or business activity.  Its object is to promote the interest s of internet 
service providers and internet consumers in India, improve quality of internet 
service , save foreign exchange , and carry  on domain name operati ons.  It is bound 
by licensing conditions – which include the prohibition from altering its 
memorandum , without the prior consent of the Union Government.  According 
to the submissions made on NIXI’s behalf, it charges annual membership fee of 
₹1000/ - and registration of second and third level domain names at ₹500/- and 
₹250/-.  The finding of the ITAT and the High Court are that NIXI ’s objects and 
functioning are by way of general public utility and thus it is a GPU category 
charity.  
210. Having regard to  the findings on record and the materials placed by the 
parties, it is evident that NIXI carries on the essential – crucial purpose of 
promoting internet services and more important ly, regulating domain name 
registration  which is extremely  essential for in ternet users in India. A country’s 
need to have a domestic internet exchange, rather than depend on an international 
one, cannot be overemphasized.  The Union Government’s object of setting up of 
internet exchange is part of its essential function as a gove rnment to regulate 
certain segment of the communication networks.  In the absence of a single entity 
authorized to register “.in” domain names, there is bound to be chaos or 
confusion.   

211. In view of the foregoing discussion , this Court is of the opinion that the 
revenue’s contention that NIXI does not merely carry -on public purpose of 
regulatory activity but is involved in trade , commerce,  or business or in providing 
service in relation thereto , cannot be accepted.   
212. The next assessee under consideration – is GS 1 India. GS1 codes were 
developed and created by GS1 International, Belgium  (an international not -for-
profit under Belgium tax law) . This coding system has been in  use worldwide  and 
is even mandatory for some servi ces/goods, or adopted for significant advantages 
being a singular identification system, recognized and accepted all over the world . 
The code promotes universal standard in Electronic Data Inter -exchanged (EDI) 
and other services. This system of coding has  been accorded priority by the 
Government of India as it is a compulsory requirement on products exported from 
India. Government of India had set up non -profit organizations EAN India , now 
known as GS1 India (the assessee).  
213. Counsel on behalf of GS1 India,  submitted that GS1 is affiliated and 
conferred exclusive rights relating to GS1 coding in India. The GS1 code  on a 
product , provides a unique identification to it with wide ranging benefits and 
advantages which facilitate tracking, tracing of the pr oduct, product recalls, 
counterfeit detection, user safety due to accuracy, wastage control through 
accurate monitoring and stock levels for commodities, security and safety of 
supply chains , detection of illegal trade , etc. The unique identification or co ding 
system developed and operated by GS1 International or GS1 India is recognized 
and accepted globally. Additionally, the unique identification code can be 
enabled with RFID chip and other electronic technology. Being one of its kinds 
globally, only a GS 1 registered organization can set up and promote the said 
system/standard within a country. These can be used for several fields including 
public distribution system, agriculture, health products , etc. and has been 
successfully used for product package lab els. The utility and benefits of a 

universal coding system assessable by anyone across the globe, for the 
consumers, government, manufacturers, traders, exporters , etc. are enormous and 
significant. Initial registration fee of ₹ 20,000/ - is charged by GS 1, plus annual 
fee of ₹4,000/ - (enhanced to ₹ 5,000/ - from financial year 2006 -07 onwards ) from 
third parties, who become subscribing members , and are entitled to use the GS1 
coding system.  
214. It was submitted on behalf of GS1 that it was set up as socie ty in 1996 and 
sponsored by the Union Government.  The Union Government representatives 
and the representatives of the trade bodies are its members.  The activities of GS1 
are extremely important and have to be characterized as involving general public 
utility.  It was submitted that having regard to the fact that GS1 provides services 
to all organizations regardless of whether they carry on business, trade or other 
commercial activity, a narrow interpretation confining the expression “service in 
relation t o” should not be adopted. It was urged, that there is no dispute about the 
fact that GS1 was directed to be granted registration under the IT Act, and that 
GS1 Belgium, the parent organization, so to say, which owns the technology , has 
been granted the sta tus of not for profit charity. GS1 urges that it is not dealing 
or treating the prized rights as a right be exploited commercially to earn or 
generate profits . It is not directly or indirectly subjecting their activity to market 
mechanism/dynamics (i.e. , demand and supply), rather it is motivated and 
prompted to serve the beneficiaries. Therefore, t his is not a case of commercial 
exploitation of intellectual property rights to earn profits  (as contended by the 
Revenue) , but rather a case where a token fee h as been fixed and payable by the 
user of the global identification system. Clause 44 of GSI’s Memorandum of 
Association of the petitioner stipulates that it is  a "Not -for-Profit" society and the 
funds/receipts are to only be used for promotion of objects of the society for 
which it is established , including sustenance and expansion.   

215. The revenue contended that although GS1 India has a monopoly, the mere 
fact that it is stated to be a Not for Profit Society with some governmental 
involvement in  its management would not detract from its essential nature; which 
is to sub -serve the interest of the business community.  It was elaborated in this 
context that GS1 by providing bar codes and the coding system  secured by 
license, not only exploit s the in tellectual property rights but is in fact engaged in 
services in relation to trade, commerce or business.  Counsel pointed to the fact 
that the revenues of GS1 has steadily increased over the years.  It was pointed out 
that according to the balance sheet t he aggregate registration fe es receipt for the 
year ending 31.03.2007 was ₹1,80,80,760/- whereas for the year ending 
31.03.2008 which had increased to ₹4,85,47,170/-.  Likewise, membership fees 
had increased from ₹44,40,000/- as on 31.03.2007 to ₹93,42,500/-.  Furthermore, 
renewal fees for the year ending 2007 was ₹1,68,57,200/- whereas for the next 
year i.e. , as on 31.03.2008 it was ₹1,90,50,650/-. The Revenue submitted that 
even where income and interest were to be excluded, the increase on a yearly  
basis was exponential.  Likewise, it was pointed out that registration fees as on 
31.03.2011 was ₹4,24,69,850/- whereas as on 31.03.2012 it was ₹6,07,58,100/-; 
subscription fee as on 31.03.2 011 was ₹1,02,06,720/-; for the next year i.e. , on 
31.03.2012 it was ₹1,01,69,850/-.  Likewise, the subscription renewal fees as on 
31.03.2011 was ₹4,18,62,804/- and the same head as on 31.03.2012 was 
₹4,46,71,134/-.   
216. The Revenue emphasis es the fact that GS1 is a monopolist organization, 
has exclusive licenses in relation to bar coding technology which it admittedly 
uses for fee or other consideration.  It is highlighted that these services are 
provided mostly to business, trade purpose, man ufactur ing, etc. On the other 
hand, GS1 urges that it performs the important public function which enables not 
merely manufactures but others involved in supplies of various articles by 
packaging , etc., to regulate and ensure their identity.  

217. In the o pinion of this Court, GS1’s functions no doubt is of general public 
utility. However,  equally  the services it performs are to aid business es 
manufactures, tradesmen and commercial establishments.  Bar coding packaged 
articles and goods assists their consig ners to identify them ; helps  manufactures, 
and marketing organizations (especially in the context of contemporary times, 
online platforms which serve as market places).  The objective of GS1 is 
therefore , to provide service in relation to business, trade o r commerce - for a fee 
or other consideration.  It is also true, that the coding system it possesses and the 
facilit ies it provides, is capable of and perhaps is being used, by other sectors, in 
the welfare or public interest fields. However, in the absenc e of any figures, 
showing the contribution of GS 1’s revenues from those segments, and whether it 
charges lower amounts, from such organizations, no inference can be drawn in 
that regard. The materials on record show that the coding services are used for 
commercial or business purposes. Having regard to these circumstances, the 
Court is of the opinion that the impugned judgment and order calls for 
interference.   
 
(v) State Cricket Associations   
218. The revenue has preferred appeals against the decision of the Gujarat High 
Court in respect of orders made in the cases of the Gujarat Cricket Association, 
the Saurashtra Cricket Association, Baroda and Rajkot Cricket Associations and 
the decision of the Rajasthan High Court, in respect of the Rajasth an Cricket 
Association. The main facts, relevant for deciding the questions involved are set 
out in the order of the ITAT151 against which the Gujarat High Court rendered the 
impugned judgment152. Since the legal issues are common in relation to all these 
 
151 ITA Nos: 1257/Ahd/13, 3303/Ahd/16, 3304/Ahd/16, 408/Ahd/17 Assessment years: 2009 -10, 2010 -11, 
2011 -12 and 2012 -13.  
152 SLP (D) No. 16597/2020 against a common judgment dated 27.9.2019, which relate to the Gujarat Cricket 
Association, Saurashtra, Baroda and Rajkot Cricket Association Cricket Association.  

matters, the facts relating to the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) may be 
considered for convenience.  
219. The objects of GCA (and other associations) are to control, supervise, 
regulate, promote or encourage, and develop the game of cricket in the area u nder 
its  jurisdiction. The association can also undertake any other and all activities 
which may be beneficial to it. GCA’s objects include activities aimed at creating, 
fostering and maintaining friendly and cordial relationship through sports 
tournament s and competitions,  to create a healthy spirit through the medium of 
sports in general, and cricket in particular. The other objects include: to instil the 
spirit of sportsmanship in school and college students, members of other 
institutions, and other ci tizens; instil the ideals of cricket and educate them in the 
same; to select teams to represent the association in any competitive forum; to 
arrange, supervise, hold, encourage and finance visits of teams; to arrange or 
manage league and/or any other tourn aments; to promote persons, meetings, 
competitions and matches in relation to sports; and to offer, give/distribute or 
contribute towards prizes, medals and awards; to lay out grounds for playing the 
game; and to provide pavilion, stadia, other convenience s and amenities in 
connection therewith. The GCA also includes within its objects, providing 
coaching to deserving persons in the various departments of the game of cricket; 
engaging professional cricketers, coaches, umpires, groundsmen, and other 
employee s, and to pay remuneration or honorarium to them; and to start, sponsor 
and/or to subscribe to any fund for the benefit of such persons or their families. 
The GCA can collect funds for the purpose of the Association and utilise it in 
such manner as its Man aging Committee considers desirable for the fulfilment of 
its objects.  
220. The assessing authorities denied GCA’s claim and that of the other 
associations, that they were charities. Before the ITAT, it was contended, on 
behalf of the revenue, inter alia, that looking at the nature of the relationship of 

these state cricket associations with the Board of Cricket Control of India (BCCI), 
the amounts received by these associations from BCCI were in the nature of 
consideration or fees, for granting media right s, and collecting their share, among 
other things. This amounted to a business or commercial activity. It would, in this 
context, be useful to quote the observations set out in the ITAT’s order (which 
were part of the commissioner’s order). The Commissione r had taken note of 
assessment proceedings in relation to BCCI, and set out its submissions:  
“9.7.2 The AO of BCCI, based on the communication of DIT(E), Mumbai, has 
not granted benefit of section 11 & 12 of the Act to BCCI. The stand taken by 
BCCI during its assessment proceedings is mentioned below. The BCCI vide 
its submission dated 03/12/2012 to the AO has explained its relationship with 
State Cricket Association as follows: - 
"1. BCCI is society registered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registrat ion 
Act. It was formed in the year 1929 with the object of promotion and 
development of cricket in India and is a member of the International Cricket 
Council (ICC) the regulatory body for world cricket. As a member of ICC, 
BCCI represents India in bilatera l tours between member countries and in 
ICC tournaments such as the World Cup.  
2. BCCI has 30 members out of whom 25 are state cricket associations, 2 are 
private clubs and 3 are Central Government Institutions. BCCI does not own 
or manage the infrastructu re and facilities that are required for cricket. It 
encourages and oversees the various state associations to promote the game, 
build the required infrastructure organize tournaments, leagues, coaching 
camps etc. in their respective states. Whenever a fore ign team visits India, the 
international matches such as Test and ODI are allotted by BCCI to the State 
Cricket Associations by a rotation policy. The matches are conducted and 
managed by the respective state associations and over time, arrangements 
have e volved about the respective responsibilities, rights, shares of revenue 
etc. These have evolved in order to promote co -operation and unity among 
the member associations and by applying the principles of equity and 
fairness, for which the sport of cricket i s renowned."  
9.7.3 The BCCI in its submission dated 21/1/2013 earned subsidy paid to 
SCAs and TV Subvention as stated as follows: - 
 
"13.2  
PAYMENTS TO STATE ASSOCIATIONS  
During the year, BCCI has paid amounts to the state associations under the 
head "TV, Subventions to Associations". This represents payment of 70% of 
the revenue from sale of media rights to the state associations".  
Whenever a foreign team visits India, the international matches such as Test 
and ODI are allotted by BCCI to the state cr icket associations by a rotation 
policy. The matches are conducted and managed by the respective state 
associations. It is not possible for BCCI to conduct all these matches with its 
own limited personnel. It is dependent on the state associations, their o ffice 

bearers, their employees and their network and resources at the local centre 
to conduct the matches.  
The association manage the entire match right from provision of security to 
players, spectators in coordination with respective state police personne l, 
taking other security measures like fire prevention etc. The association incurs 
a good chunk of expenditure in conducting an International 
Test/ODI/T20/IPL/CL T20 Matches.  
In order to have fair and equitable sharing of the revenues, arrangements 
have ev olved over time, about the respective responsibilities, rights, shares of 
revenue etc. of BCCI and the state associations. The state association is 
entitled to the ticket revenue and ground sponsorship revenues. Expenses on 
account of security for players and spectators, temporary stands, operation 
of floodlights, Score Boards, management of crowd. Insurance for the match, 
electricity charges, catering etc are met by the state associations. On the other 
had expenditure on transportation of players and other  match officials, 
boarding and lodging, expenses on food for players and officials, tour fee, 
match fee, etc are met by BCCI and revenues from sponsorship belong to 
BCCI. In respect of revenues from sale of media rights, an arrangement has 
evolved over tim e. Until 1991 -92 the income from media rights was meager. 
With the growth in income from media rights, it became necessary to optimize 
the arrangement for sale of media rights. For a Test series or ODI series 
conducted in multiple centers and organised by BCCI and multiple state 
associations, it was found that if each state association were to negotiate the 
sale of rights to events in its centre, its negotiating strength would be low. It 
was, therefore, agreed that BCCI would negotiate the sale of media rig hts for 
the entire country to optimize the income under this head. It was further 
decided that out of the receipts from the sale of media rights 70% of the gross 
revenue less production cost would belong to the state associations. Every 
year, BCCI has paid  out exactly 70% of its receipts from media rights (less - 
production cost) to the state associations. This amount has been utilized by 
the respective associations to build infrastructure and promote cricket, 
making the game more popular, nurturing and enco uraging cricket talent, 
and leading to higher revenues from media rights.  
*************      ****************  
Even in the event that exemption under section 11 is denied, the payments to 
state associations must be allowed as a deduction, as expenditure laid  out or 
expended wholly and exclusively for the purpose of earning such income, it 
must be appreciated that in order to earn revenues, BCCI was and continues 
to be highly dependent on the state associations. BCCI does not have the 
infrastructure and the re sources to conduct the matches by itself and is 
dependent on the state associations to conduct the matches. The income from 
media rights is dependent on the efforts of the state associations in conducting 
the matches from which the media rights accrue. The  division of revenues and 
expenditure is a matter of arrangement between the parties. Certain incomes 
such as sale of ticket revenues belong to the state associations, who meet the 
expenditure on the matches such as security for players and spectators 
temp orary stands, operation of floodlights, Score Boards, management of 
crowd, insurance for the match, electricity charges, catering etc. Whereas 
with regard to the income from sale of media rights, the arrangement between 

BCCI and the State Associations has been that 70% of the revenue would 
belong to the State Associations. As shown, this has been the arrangement 
between the parties for the twenty years. The State Associations are entitled 
by virtue of established practice to 70% of the media right fee. It i s in 
expectation of this revenue that the various state associations take an active 
part and cooperate in the conduct of the matches. This payment is therefore 
made only with a view to earn the income from media rights.”  
 
221. The ITAT accepted the assesse e’s contentions, and held that the 
associations were GPU charities:  
“35. Let us take a pause here and examine as to what are the activities of the 
assessee cricket associations so as to be brought within the ambit of trade, 
commerce or business. We have se en objects of the association, which are 
reproduced earlier in our order, and it is not even the case of the revenue 
that these objects have anything to do with any trade, commerce or business; 
these objects are simply to promote cricket. The trigger for i nvoking proviso 
to Section 2(15), as Shri Soparkar rightly contends, has to an activity of the 
assessee which is in the nature of trade, commerce or business. However, 
the case of the revenue authorities hinges on the allegation that the way and 
manner in which cricket matches are being organized, particularly the IPL 
matches, the activity of organizing cricket matches is nothing but brute 
commerce. Undoubtedly, it would appear that right from the time Kerry 
Packer started his World Series Cricket in 1977, there has been no looking 
back in commercialization of cricket and the impact of this 
commercialization has not left Indian cricket intact. The Indian Premier 
League and the rules of the game being governed by the dictates of 
commercial considerations may seem to be one such example of 
commercialization of Indian cricket. The difficulty for the case of the revenue 
before us, however, is that these matches are not being organized by the local 
cricket associations. We are told that the matches are being organ ized by the 
Board of Cricket Control of India, but then, if we are to accept this claim 
and invoke the proviso to Section 2(15) for this reason, it will amount to a 
situation in which proviso to Section 2(15) is being invoked on account of 
activities of an  entity other than the assessees - something which law does not 
permit. We are not really concerned, at this stage, whether the allegations 
about commercialization of cricket by the BCCI are correct or not, because 
that aspect of the matter would be relevan t only for the purpose of proviso 
to Section 2(15) being invoked in the hands of the BCCI. We do not wish to 
deal with that aspect of the matter or to make any observations which would 
prejudge the case of the BCCI. Suffice to say that the very foundation of 
revenue's case is devoid of legally sustainable basis for the short reason that 
the commercialization of cricket by the BCCI, even if that be so, cannot be 
reason enough to invoke the proviso to Section 2(15). We are alive o learned 
Commissioner (DR)'s suggestion that the cricket associations cannot be seen 
on standalone basis as the BCCI is nothing but an apex body of these cricket 
associations at a collective level and whatever BCCI does is at the behest of 
or with the connivance of the local cricket a ssociations, and that it is not the 
case that anyone can become a Member of the BCCI because only a 

recognized cricket association can become a Member of the BCCI. We are 
also alive to learned Commissioner's argument that what is being sought to 
be protect ed by the charitable status of these associations is the share of 
these cricket associations from the commercial profits earned by the BCCI 
by organizing the cricket matches. The problem, however, is that the 
activities of the apex body, as we have explain ed earlier, cannot be reason 
enough to trigger proviso to Section 2(15) in these cases. Whether these 
cricket associations collectively constitute BCCI or not, in the event of BCCI 
being involved in commercial activities, the taxability of such commercial 
profits will arise in the hands of the BCCI and not the end beneficiaries. Even 
in such a case the point of taxability of these profits is the BCCI and not the 
cricket associations, because, even going by learned Commissioner's 
arguments, these receipts in  the hands of the cricket associations is nothing 
but appropriation of profits. What can be taxed is accrual of profits and not 
appropriation of profits. In any event, distinction between the cricket 
associations and the BCCI cannot be ignored for the purp oses of tax 
treatment. There is no dispute that the matches were organized by the BCCI, 
and the assessee cannot thus be faulted for the commercial considerations 
said to be inherent in planning the matches. As we make these observations, 
and as we do not h ave the benefit of hearing the perspective of the BCCI, we 
make it clear that these observations will have no bearing on any 
adjudication in the hands of the BCCI. Suffice to say that so far as the cricket 
associations are concerned, the allegations of the  revenue authorities have 
no bearing on the denial of the status of 'charitable activities' in the hands 
of the cricket associations before us - particularly as learned Commissioner 
has not been able to point out a single object of the assessee cricket 
associations which is in the nature of trade, commerce or business, and, as 
it is not even in dispute that the objects being pursued by the assessee cricket 
associations are "objects of general public utility" under section 2(15). All 
the objects of the assess ee cricket associations, as reproduced earlier in this 
order, unambiguously seek to promote the cricket, and this object, as has 
been all along accepted by the CBDT itself, an object of general public 
utility.”  
 
222. In granting relief, the ITAT was persua ded by the decision of the Madras 
High Court, in Tamil Nadu Cricket Association v. Director of Income Tax 
(Exemptions) & Ors.153, and held  
“54. The assessee is a member of the Board of Control for Cricket in India 
(BCCI), which in turn is a member of ICC (International Cricket Council). 
BCCI allots test matches with visiting foreign team and one day international 
matches to various member cri cket associations which organise the matches 
in their stadia. The franchisees conduct matches in the stadia belonging to 
the State cricket association. The State association is entitled to all in -stadia 
sponsorship advertisement and beverage revenue and it  incurs expenses for 
the conduct of the matches. BCCI earns revenue by way of sponsorship and 
 
153 [2014] 360 ITR 633 (Mad)  

media rights as well as franchisee revenue for IPL and it distributes 70 per 
cent, of the revenue to the member cricket association. Thus, the assessee is 
also th e recipient of the revenue. Thus, for invoking section 12AA read with 
section 2(15) of the Act, the Revenue has to show that the activities are not 
fitting with the objects of the association and that the dominant activities are 
in the nature of trade, com merce and business. We do not think that by the 
volume of receipt one can draw the inference that the activity is commercial. 
The Income -tax Appellate Tribunal's view that it is an entertainment and, 
hence, offended section 2(15) of the Act does not appear  to be correct and 
the same is based on its own impression on free ticket, payment of 
entertainment tax and presence of cheer group and given the irrelevant 
consideration. These considerations are not germane in considering the 
question as to whether the a ctivities are genuine or carried on in accordance 
with the objects of the association. We can only say that the Income -tax 
Appellate Tribunal rested its decision on consideration which are not 
relevant for considering the test specified under section 12AA( 3) to impose 
commercial character to the activity of the association. In the circumstances, 
we agree with the assessee that the Revenue has not made out any ground to 
cancel the registration under section 12AA(3) of the Act.  
55. As regards the observation of the Income -tax Appellate Tribunal that IPL 
matches and Celebrity cricket matches are also being held by the association 
and hence, it is an entertainment industry, we need not go into these aspects 
for the order of the Director of Income -tax (Exemptions ) casts no doubt on 
the genuineness of the objects of the trust. Hence, it is for the Assessing 
Officer to take note of all facts, while considering the same under section 11 
of the Income -tax Act, 1961. We disapprove the approach of the Tribunal in 
this r egard. In the above said circumstances, we set aside the order of the 
Income -tax Appellate Tribunal.”  
 
223. The ITAT agreed with the assessees that TV subsidy amounts received by 
the associations were “corpus donations” in furtherance of the BCCI’s resolut ion 
dated 05.09.2001. It accordingly held that these amounts were in the capital field, 
irrespective of whether they were fully utilized by the state association, or 
whether some part of it, was given to district associations. Thus, for AY 2009 -
2010, the s um of ₹3,52,86,521 paid by BCCI to GCA was subsidy , falling in the 
capital field.  
224. It was urged on behalf of the Revenue that the cricket associations are not 
carrying on any charitable activity; reliance was placed on the facts to say that 
substantia l amounts were received by the state associations, towards their share 
of sale of media rights (as constituents or members of BCCI) , which are 
commercial receipts. Although the sale of those rights was by the BCCI, the lion’s 

share of those amounts was tha t of the respective state associations. Furthermore, 
the state associations owned the stadia, and actually conducted the matches, in 
respect of which stadium advertisements and sponsorship amounts were received: 
these, too, were in the nature of business o r commercial activities. The assessees 
on the other hand, submitted that they are distinct from the BCCI. It was sought 
to be urged that the activity of sports and sport promotion is basically education , 
and hence, per se  exempt. Realizing the value of inculcating sportsmanship and 
fostering the culture of sport, Parliament had introduced Section 10(23), to 
exempt income received by sports bodies. However, that was deleted w.e.f. 
01.04.2003. It was argued that this does no t preclude sports bodies, like cricket 
associations from claiming to be charities. It was urged that even if the court were 
not to consider the cricket associations to be education -related charities, they 
cannot be denied the status of GPU charities, havin g regard to the sports 
promotional nature of their objects. It was submitted that these bodies are 
primarily responsible for fostering the sport, talent spotting, nurturing it, and 
providing opportunities to those who have the aptitude and passion for the game 
of cricket. All these are objects of general public utility. It was submitted that the 
amounts which BCCI collects may or may not be in the course of commerce; 
however, what is given to the associations is subsidy, which cannot be termed as 
considerat ion for carrying on any commercial activity.  
225. At the outset, the contention that sports promotion is ‘education’ and 
hence, per se exempt, has to be dealt with. In Lok Shikshana Trust (supra) this 
court has comprehensively addressed the scope of the term, and conclude that it 
would entail “scholastic” education:  
“5. The sense in which the word “education” has been used in Section 2(15) 
is the systematic instruction, schooling or traini ng given to the young in 
preparation for the work of life. It also connotes the whole course of 
scholastic instruction which a person has received. The word “education” 
has not been used in that wide and extended sense, according to which every 
acquisition  of further knowledge constitutes education. According to this wide 
and extended sense, travelling is education, because as a result of travelling 

you acquire fresh knowledge. Likewise, if you read newspapers and 
magazines, see pictures, visit art gallerie s, museums and zoos, you thereby 
add to your knowledge. Again, when you grow up and have dealings with 
other people, some of whom are not straight, you learn by experience and 
thus add to your knowledge of the ways of the world. If you are not careful, 
your wallet is liable to be stolen or you are liable to be cheated by some 
unscrupulous person. The thief who removes your wallet and the swindler 
who cheats you teach you a lesson and in the process make you wiser though 
poorer. If you visit a night club, yo u get acquainted with and add to your 
knowledge about some of the not much revealed realities and mysteries of life. 
All this in a way is education in the great school of life. But that is not the 
sense in which the word “education” is used in clause (15) of Section 2. What 
education connotes in that clause is the process of training and developing 
the knowledge, skill, mind and character of students by formal schooling.”  
  
Therefore, there is no doubt that the claim of the present sport associations will 
not fall within ‘education’ and will have to be examined under the fourth limb of 
Section 2(15) – i.e., GPU category, if it is to make a case for tax exemption.   
226. BCCI is the body which regulates cricket and represents the country. 
Within the country it organizes and conducts the Ranji Trophy, the Irani Trophy, 
the Duleep Singh Trophy, the Deodar Trophy and the NKP Salve Challenge 
Trophy. These are domestic events, yet only those who are members of the Board 
and/or recognized by it can take part in these events. The members of the Board 
(entitled to  vote in its election) are the state cricket associations.154  The BCCI is 
the country -level cricket regulator both off and on the fields, and its functions 
include selection of players and umpires. The International Cricket Council (of 
which BCCI, as the r epresentative body of the country, is a member) possesses 
and exercises all the powers to regulate international competitive cricket. It also 
exercises disciplinary power – in case of violation of the rules, a country member 
or the player may be derecogniz ed. The ICC exercises a monopoly over the sports 
at the international level whereas BCCI does so at the country level. BCCI  
recognizes bodies which are entitled to participate in the nominated tournaments. 
Players and umpires also are to be registered wit h it.  
 
154 Rule 3 (a) (ii) (B) of the latest BCCI Memorandum of Association and the Rules and Regulations  

227. The game of competitive cricket, at the organizational level is structured 
in such a manner that BCCI has  umbilical ties with the state associations. Not 
only are the latter, the members who constitute BCCI and elect its governing 
bodies, they also own vital infrastructure necessary to play cricket: such as stadia, 
and all related facilities. BCCI does not own those facilities or infrastructure  and 
depends on them . Furthermore, the state associations are the channels through 
which players are  mostly selected, and get opportunities to participate in state, 
national and international level cricket.  
228. As things stand, therefore, the state associations and BCCI are linked 
closely. The management of the game of cricket is structured in such a way that 
this link is apparent at every match or fixture of significance. In the course of 
conducting matches (which are scheduled by the BCCI as the national co -
ordinating body), apart from amounts received towards sale of entry tickets, the 
state association s also receive advertisement money, sponsorship fee, etc. from 
the BCCI. Aside from these, media rights - i.e., broadcasting rights to each 
national or international event conducted at various locales owned by the state 
associations, and digital rights (al l of which are exclusive , in nature) - are 
auctioned by BCCI. As noticed above, the BCCI, by its own admission, 
negotiates the terms on which media rights are sold, on behalf of the state 
associations:  
“For a Test series or ODI series conducted in multiple  centers and 
organised by BCCI and multiple state associations, it was found that if each 
state association were to negotiate the sale of rights to events in its centre, 
its negotiating strength would be low. It was, therefore, agreed that BCCI 
would negot iate the sale of media rights for the entire country to optimize 
the income under this head. It was further decided that out of the receipts 
from the sale of media rights 70% of the gross revenue less production cost 
would belong to the state associations.  Every year, BCCI has paid out 
exactly 70% of its receipts from media rights (less - production cost) to the 
state associations. This amount has been utilized by the respective 
associations to build infrastructure and promote cricket, making the game 
more p opular, nurturing and encouraging cricket talent, and leading to 
higher revenues from media rights.”  
 

229. These  media, or broadcasting rights, are in the nature of intellectual 
property rights: under Section 37 to 40 of the Copyrights Act, 1957. These rights - 
especially television and digital rights enable the licensee or the successful bidder 
to exploit the teleca st or broadcast commercially, by carrying advertisements of 
various products and services, in the media. Given that (i) BCCI does not own 
the stadia, and uses the entire physical infrastructure of the state associations (ii) 
expressly negotiates on their b ehalf for the sale of such rights (which appear to 
be purely commercial contracts), the associations’ assertions that they only 
received subsidy  from BCCI, needed closer examination.   
230. The income and expenditure account for the year ending on 31.03.2009 
shows that the total income of the GCA was ₹4,03,98,736.81. Of these 
sponsorship money was ₹20,00,000/ -; bank interest was ₹2,21,88,527.05 and as 
against the head ‘India v. South Africa t est match’, the sum of ₹1,51,97,741/ - has 
been shown. Of the total of ₹2,21,02,441.45 shown as income, ₹32,24,591.25 is 
shown as expenditure, only a fraction appears to have been expended towards 
promotion of cricket . This is apparent from the following:  
S. No.  Details of expenditure  Amounts  
1. Ground equipment of District Cricket Association  ₹ 29,34,394/ - 
2. Prize money to all teams  ₹ 27,86,796/ - 
3. Ground expenditure  ₹ 20,06,228/ - 
4. Cricket academy expenses  ₹ 9,51,067/ - 
5. Coach Fee  ₹ 10,06,040/ - 
6. Senior and Junior tournament subsidy to District 
Cricket Association  ₹ 7,00,000/ - 
 Total  ₹ 1,03,84,525/ - 
 
231. The details of the subsidy amounts received from BCCI for every match 
has been shown. This aggregates to over ₹41 lakhs. Furthermore, the details 
received towards the India -South Africa test fixture paid between 03.04.2008 -

04.04.2008 has been shown. GCA received ₹1,57,00,000/ - towards sale of space; 
ticket sales yielded ₹27,57,700 and towards the head screen income, a sum of ₹3 
lakhs was received. After deducting the expenditure, the excess income received 
for the year was ₹1,51,97,741/ -. 
232. In the case of Saurashtra Cricket Association, for the year ended on 
31.03.2012 , various heads of income have been disclosed. These include entry 
fees which is ₹5200 onwards. Interest of income received from Fixed Deposits 
was to the tu ne of ₹8,85,67,418/ -; total amount of subsidy received from BCCI is 
₹17,56,72,490/ -. Of these, the overwhelming share is towards the IPL money 
collected by the BCCI – wherein Saurashtra Cricket Association’s share worked 
out to a total of ₹17,16,32,490/ -. 
233. Apart from this, the BCCI also reimbursed to Saurashtra Cricket 
Association the sum of ₹73,73,911/ -. The income and expenditure account shows 
a head titled “subvention income from BCCI” to the extent of ₹8,14,53,834/ -. 
After deducting the heads of exp enditure, excess of income over expenditure for 
the AY was ₹69,96,537/ -. The Cricket Association showed in the expenditure 
column that the sum of ₹24,00,00,000/ - was transferred to the Cricket 
infrastructure fund. For the previous year, a sum of ₹21,21,00, 000/- was 
transferred to the stadium fund.  
234. It is quite evident that the activities of the cricket associations are run on 
business lines. The associations own physical and other infrastructure, maintain 
them, have arrangements for permanent manpower a nd have well -organised 
supply chains to cater to the several matches they host. Many such matches are 
not at national level and are under -16 or under -18 matches at the regional level. 
However, these activities are not to be seen in isolation but are to be regarded as 
part of the overall scheme , and ecosystem  in which the game of cricket is 
organized in India. Talent is spotted, at local levels and dependent on the promise 
shown, given appropriate exposure.  

235. On a close scrutiny of the expenses borne, ha ving regard to the nature of 
receipts, the expenditure incurred by Cricket Associations does not disclose that 
any significant  proportion is expended  towards sustained or organized coaching 
camps or academies. Therefore, in the opinion of this court, the I TAT fell into 
error in not considering the nature of receipts flowing from the BCCI into the 
corpus of GCA and SCA – as well as other associations that are before this court - 
to determine their true character. The ITAT appears to have been swayed by the 
submission that the amount given by the BCCI were towards capital subsidy.  
236. To determine whether a given receipt is to be characterized as falling in the 
revenue or capital stream, the objective for which it is given as well as the manner 
in which it is utilized has to be scrutinized. This aspect has been highlighted in 
Sahney Ste el & Press Works Ltd v. Commissioner of Income Tax155 in the 
following terms:  
“It is not the source from which the amount is paid to the assessee which is 
determinative of the question whether the subsidy payments are of revenue or 
capital nature. The first  proposition stated by Viscount Simon in  Ostime 
case [28 TC 261 : (1946) 1 All ER 668] is that if payments in the nature of 
subsidy from public funds are made to the assessee to assist him in carrying 
on his trade or business, they are trade receipts.”  
 
This has later been followed in  Commissioner of Income Tax v. Ponni 
Sugars156. 
237. Recent trends have shown that media rights, especially broadcasting and 
digital media rights have yielded colossal revenues to the BCCI. The model 
adopted in the last 10 years or so has been to auction media rights in respect of 
events over a 3 or 5 -year p eriod. As discussed previously, these media rights are 
not per se owned by BCCI , which is but an association of persons or agglomerate 
of all the State Cricket Association. The stadia which form the venue for these 
cricket matches (in relation to which med ia rights are transferred or licensed) are 
 
155 1997 (Supp 4) SCR 189  
156  2008 (9) SCC 337  

owned by the State Cricket Associations. According to the BCCI itself, the State 
Associations can well bargain and enter into arrangements for the sale of such 
media rights. However, to obtain better terms, and ga in bargaining leverage a 
centralized form of sale of such rights has been agreed and adopted by which the 
BCCI auctions these rights on behalf of the State Associations. All State 
Associations put together are entitled to 70% of the revenue – i.e., the pro ceeds 
of sale of the media rights. This may or may not be in proportion to the events 
hosted by each or some of the cricket associations. Yet, this forms part of the 
arrangement by which the consideration flowing from such commercial rights has 
been agreed  to be shared amongst all members of the BCCI. These rights are 
apparently commercial.  
238. In the light of these, the Court is of the opinion that the ITAT – as well as 
the High Court fell into error in accepting at face value the submission that the 
amou nts made over by BCCI to the cricket associations were in the nature of 
infrastructure subsidy. In each case, and for every year, the tax authorities are 
under an obligation to carefully examine and see the pattern of receipts and 
expenditure. Whilst doing  so, the nature of rights conveyed by the BCCI to the 
successful bidders, in other words, the content of broadcast rights as well as the 
arrangement with respect to state associations (either in the form of master 
documents, resolutions or individual agree ments with state associations) have to 
be examined. It goes without saying that there need not be an exact correlation or 
a proportionate division between the receipt and the actual expenditure. This is in 
line with the principle that what is an adequate c onsideration for something which 
is agreed upon by parties is a matter best left to them. These observations are not 
however, to be treated as final; the parties’ contentions in this regard are to be 
considered on their merit.  
(vi) Private trusts  
(a) Tribune Trust  

239. The Tribune Trust was constituted pursuant to a will executed by late 
Sardar Dial Singh Majithia. In clause (xxi) of his Will – after nominating three 
trustees, the testator directed that they ought to maintain a press and a newspaper; 
in clause (xx) the testator directed that his property in the Tribune Press and 
newspaper would vest permanently in a Committee of Trustees who would 
thereafter maintain them and “ keep up the liberal policy of the newspaper and 
activity and the excess income after curren t expenses in improving the said 
newspaper and place it on a footing of permanency” . 
240. Under the old Act, a question arose as to whether the activity of running a 
newspaper was one of general public utility; the revenue disallowed the 
exemption for AY 1 932-33. This was affirmed by the Lahore High Court. The 
Privy Council by its decision in In Re: Trustees of Tribune (supra)  allowed the 
trust’s appeal and held that the trust was neither constituted for private profit 
either to the testator nor to any othe r private person , and that the object of the 
paper could be described as one “ supplying the province with an organ of 
educated public opinion ”. The Privy Council, therefore, reasoned that the Trust 
was established as a GPU charity.  
241. Apparently, the tru st was continuously treated as a GPU category charity 
and exempted under Section 10(23C)(iv) from 1984 -85 onwards. For AY 2009 -
10, after considering the revised return of the trust, the Revenue was of the 
opinion that it was not entitled to claim exemption  under Section 10(23C). The 
Punjab and Haryana High Court which dealt with the Trust’s present appeal was 
of the opinion that in Surat Art Silk  (supra), this court had considered the 
judgment of the Privy Council. In that judgment, this Court had made some  
observations that even though the activity of the publication of newspaper was 
carried on commercial lines with the object of earning profit, it was an activity 
engaged by the Trust for the purposes of carrying out its charitable objects. The 
High Court u pheld the revenue’s contention and based upon its analysis of 

Section 2(15) concluded that the Trust’s income derived from its activities were 
based on profit motive. In doing so, it was noticed that 85% of the trust’s revenue 
was from advertisements and i nterest. The total revenue was ₹161 crores out of 
which ₹124.87 crores was received from advertisements and ₹11.38 crores from 
interest on FDRs; ₹17.49 crores was from sale of newspapers and ₹3.74 crores 
from subscriptions of the dailies.  
242. It was argue d on behalf of the trust that it was never intended and in fact, 
not run on profitable basis. No part of its income was ever disbursed to any private 
individual through profit sharing or otherwise, nor distributed for any purpose 
other than the activities of the Trust. It was submitted that the High Court’s 
surmise that the accumulation of large profits and its assumption that the Trust 
could utilize them for non -charitable purposes in future, was unfounded. In this 
regard, it was submitted that till 2008 -09 all assessments were completed, since 
the Revenue was satisfied that more than 85% had been ploughed back  to feed 
the main charitable activity.  
243. It is noticed from the impugned judgment that the High Court concedes to 
the fact that the trust’s activ ities were held by the Privy Council to  constitute 
financing of objects of ‘general public utility’; further that merely because 
thousands of newspapers were being published made no difference. It still 
continues to be a GPU charity.  
244. The question the n is whether the nature of receipts and income garnered by 
the Trust, in the course of actually carrying out its activity of publishing 
newspaper, can be characterized as “ in the nature of trade, commerce or 
business ” or “ service in relation to trade, comm erce or business ”, for any 
consideration. During the course of submissions, it was urged that advertisement 
revenue should not be treated as business or commercial receipts since that 
virtually is the lifeblood which sustains the activity of publication of  newspapers. 
It was highlighted that the object of maintaining the activity of publishing and 

distribution of newspaper remains the advancement of general public utility, as it 
has the effect of both notifying and educating the general public about the cur rent 
affairs and developments. The inclusion of advertisements also serves as 
information to the general public, especially in areas of employment, availability 
of resources, etc. Therefore, publication of advertisement is intrinsically 
connected with the activity of printing and publishing of newspapers.  
245. The publication of advertisements for consideration, in the opinion of the 
court,  by the newspaper, cannot but be termed as an activity in the nature of 
carrying on business, trade or commerce for a fee or consideration. That the 
newspaper published by th e trust (“the Tribune”) in this case is funded mainly 
through advertisement is no basis for holding that publishing such advertisements 
by the Trust does not constitute business. The object of the trust to involve or 
engage in publication of newspapers. Pu blishing advertisements is obviously to 
garner receipts which are in the nature of profit. Now, by virtue of the amended 
definition of Section 2(15), GPU charities can engage themselves in business or 
commercial activity or profit, only if  the receipts fro m such activities do not 
exceed the quantitative limit of the overall receipts earned in a given year. While 
the asse ssee’s contention that publication of advertisement is intrinsically linked 
with newspaper activity (thereby fulfilling sub -clause (i) of t he proviso to Section 
2(15), i.e. an activity in the course of actual carrying on of the activity towards 
advancement of the object) is acceptable, nevertheless, the condition imposed by 
sub-clause (ii) of the proviso to Section 2(15) has to also be fulfil led. In the 
present case, that percentage had been exceeded, as evident from the record.  
246. In the light of the foregoing discussion, this court is of the opinion that the 
impugned judgment and order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court cannot be 
sustained, to the extent it holds that the Tribune trust is not a GPU charity. 
However, having regard  to the factual analysis, the judgment needs no 
interference.  

(b) Shri Balaji Samaj Vikas Samiti  
247. The revenue appeals a decision of the Allahabad High Court157 affirming 
the order of the ITAT which had directed the CIT to grant registration under 
Section 12AA of the Income Tax Act.  
248. The assessee  is a registered society which was formed with the object of 
establishing and running a health club, Arogya Kendra; its object in cluded 
organization of emergency relief centres , etc. Other objects, included promotion 
of moral values, eradication of child labour, dowry , etc. The assessee had entered 
into arrangements with the state agencies to supply mid -day meals to students of 
prim ary schools in different villages through contracts entered into with the Basic 
Shiksha Adhikari, District Meerut. It is a matter of record that the materials for 
preparation of mid -day meal was supplied by the government. The assessee 
society claimed that  it only obtains nominal charges for preparation of mid -day 
meals. The assessee’s claim for registration was rejected on the ground that it was 
involved in commercial activity. Upon appeal, the ITAT agreed with the assessee 
that supply of mid -day meals did  not constitute business or commerce and that it 
promoted the objects of general public utility.  
249. The revenue in its appeal contends that the assessee’s only activity for the 
relevant year was supply of mid -day meals to primary schools. This was not 
relatable to any object of the society. The assessee’s contention is that the state 
ordinarily would have carried on the activity of supply of mid -day meals. Yet, 
nevertheless it outsourced its activity to an outside agency like the assessee which 
performed  it for nominal charges.  
250. This court is of the opinion that there is no clarity with respect to whether 
the activity of supplying mid -day meals falls within the objects clause of the 
assessee society. The order of the ITAT as well as the High Court di sclosed that 
 
157 Dated 09.02.2018 in ITA 49/2014.  

the assessee’s objects involved maintenance of health clubs, Arogya Kendra, 
promotion of moral values and provision of emergency relief. These do not 
however include the activity which it actually performed, i.e. , entering into 
contracts for s upply of mid -day meals and the activity of cooking and supply of 
mid-day meals. In the absence of fuller material, it would not be possible for the 
court to assess the activity with which the assessee was engaged, and determine 
whether it could be said to legitimately fall within the description of GPU.  
251. The first consideration would be whether the activity concerned was or is 
in any manner covered by the objects clause. Secondly, the revenue authorities 
should also consider the express terms of the co ntract or contracts entered into by 
the assessee with the State or its agencies. If on the basis of such contracts, the 
accounts disclose that the amounts paid are nominal mark -up over and above the 
cost incurred towards supplying the services, the activit y may fall within the 
description of one advancing the general public utility. If on the other hand, there 
is a significant mark -up over the actual cost of service, the next step would be 
ascertain whether the quantitative  limit in the  proviso to Section 2(15) is adhered 
to. It is only in the event of the trust actually carrying on an activity in the course 
of achieving one of its objects, and earning income which should not exceed the 
quantitative limit prescribed at the relevant time , that it can be said to be driven 
by charitable purpose.  
252. This court, in the normal circumstances, having regard to the above 
discussion, would have remitted the matter for consideration. However, it is 
apparent from the records that the tax effect is  less than Rs.10 lakhs. It is apparent 
that the receipt from the activities in the present case did not exceed the 
quantitative limit of Rs.10 lakhs prescribed at the relevant time. In the 
circumstances, the impugned order of the High Court does not call f or 
interference.  
 

IV. Summation of conclusions  
253. In view of the foregoing discussion and analysis, the following conclusions 
are recorded regarding the interpretation of the changed definition of “charitable 
purpose” (w.e.f. 01.04.2009), as well as the lat er amendments, and other related 
provisions of the IT Act.  
A.  General test under Section 2(15)  
A.1. It is clarified that an assessee advancing general public utility cannot 
engage itself in any trade, commerce or business , or provide service in relation 
thereto for any consideration (“cess, or fee, or any other consideration”);  
A.2. However, in the course of achieving the object of general public utility, the 
concerned trust, society, or other such organization, can carry o n trade, commerce 
or business or provide services in relation thereto for consideration, provided that 
(i) the activities of trade, commerce or business are connected  (“actual carrying 
out…” inserted w.e.f. 01.04.2016) to the achievement of its objects of GPU; and 
(ii) the receipt from such business or commercial activity or service in relation 
thereto, does not exceed the quantified limit, as amended over the years (Rs. 10 
lakhs w.e.f. 01.04.2009 ; then Rs. 25 lakhs w.e.f. 01.04.2012 ; and now 20% of 
total r eceipts of the previous year , w.e.f. 01.04.2016);  
A.3. Generally, the charging of any amount towards consideration for such an 
activity ( advancing  general public utility), which is on cost -basis or nominally 
above cost, cannot be considered to be “trade, c ommerce, or business” or any 
services in relation thereto. It is only when the charges are markedly or 
significantly above the cost incurred by the asse ssee in question, that they would 
fall within the mischief of “cess, or fee, or any other consideration”  towards 
“trade, commerce or business”. In this regard, the Court has clarified through 
illustrations what kind of services or goods provided on cost or nominal basis 

would normally be excluded from the mischief of trade, commerce, or business, 
in the body  of the judgment.  
A.4. Section 11(4A) must be interpreted harmoniously with Section 2(15), with 
which there is no conflict. Carrying out activity in the nature of trade, commerce 
or business, or service in relation to such activities, should be conducted i n the 
course of achieving the GPU object, and the income, profit or surplus or gains 
must, therefore, be incidental . The requirement in Section 11(4A) of maintaining 
separate books of account is also in line with the necessity of demonstrating that 
the qua ntitative limit prescribed in the proviso to Section 2(15), has not been 
breached. Similarly, the insertion of Section 13(8), seventeenth proviso to Section 
10(23 C) and third proviso to Section 143(3) (all w.r.e.f. 01.04.2009), reaffirm this 
interpretation  and bring uniformity across the statutory provisions.  
B. Authorities, corporations, or bodies established by statute  
B.1.  The amounts or any money whatsoever charged by a statutory  corporation, 
board or any other body set up by the state government or central governments, 
for achieving what are essentially ‘public functions/services’ (such as housing, 
industrial development, supply of water, sewage management, supply of food 
grain, development and town planning, etc.) may resemble  trade, commercial, or 
business activities. However, since their objects are essential for advancement of 
public purposes/functions (and are accordingly restrained by way of statutory 
provisions), such recei pts are prima facie  to be excluded  from the mischief of 
business or commercial receipts. This is in line with the larger bench judgments 
of this court in Ramtanu  Cooperative Housing Society  and NDMC (supra).   
B.2. However, at the same time, in every case, the assessing authorities would 
have to apply their minds and scrutinize the records, to determine if, and to what 
extent, the consideration or amounts charged are significantly higher  than the cost 
and a nominal m ark-up. If such is the case, then the receipts would indicate that 
the activities are in fact in the nature of “trade, commerce or business” and as a 

result, would have to comply with the quantified limit (as amended from time to 
time) in the proviso to Se ction 2(15) of the IT Act.  
B.3. In clause (b) of Section 10(46) of the IT Act, “commercial” has the same 
meaning as “trade, commerce, business” in Section 2(15) of the IT Act. 
Therefore, sums charged by such notified  body, authority, Board, Trust or 
Commi ssion (by whatever name called) will require similar consideration – i.e., 
whether it is at cost with a nominal mark -up or significantly higher, to determine 
if it falls within the mischief of “commercial activity”. However, in the case of 
such notified bo dies, there is no quantified limit in Section 10(46). Therefore, the 
Central Government would have to decide on a case -by-case basis whether and 
to what extent, exemption can be awarded to bodies that are notified under 
Section 10( 46). 
B.4. For the period 01.04.2003 to 01.04.2011, a statutory corporation could 
claim the benefit of Section 2(15) having regard to the judgment of this Court in 
the Gujarat Maritime Board case (supra). Likewise, the denial of benefit under 
Section 10(46) after 01.04.2011 does not preclude a statutory corporation, board, 
or whatever such body may be called, from claiming that it is set up for a 
charitable purpose and seeking exemption under Sectio n 10(23C) or other 
provisions of the Act.  
C. Statutory regulators  
C.1. The income and receipts of statutory regulatory  bodies  which are for 
instance, tasked with exclusive duties of prescribing curriculum, disciplining 
professionals and prescribing standard s of professional conduct, are prima facie 
not business or commercial receipts. However, this is subject to the caveat that if 
the assessing authorities discern that certain kinds of activities carried out by such 
regulatory body involved charging of fees that are significantly higher  than the 
cost incurred (with a nominal mark -up) or providing other  facilities or services 
such as admission forms, coaching classes, registration processing fees, etc. , at 

markedly higher prices, those would constitute commerc ial or business receipts. 
In that event, the overall quantitative limit prescribed in the proviso to Section 
2(15) (as amended from time to time) has to be complied with, if the regulatory 
body is to be considered as one with ‘charitable purpose’ eligible for exemption 
under the IT Act.  
C.2. Like statutory authorities which regulate professions, statutory bodies 
which certify products (such as seeds) based on standards for qualification, etc. 
will also be treated similarly.  
D. Trade promotion bodies  
Bodies involved in trade promotion (such as AEPC), or set up with the objects of 
purely advocating for, coordinating and assisting trading organisations, can be 
said to be involved in advancement of objects of general public utility . However, 
if such organisation s provide additional services such as courses meant to skill 
personnel, providing private rental spaces in fairs or trade shows, consulting 
services, etc. then income or receipts from such activities, would be business or 
commercial in nature. In that even t, the claim for tax exemption would have to 
be again subjected to the rigors of the proviso to Section 2(15) of the IT Act.  
E. Non-statutory bodies  
E.1. In the present batch of cases, non -statutory bodies performing public 
functions, such as ERNET and NIXI  are engaged in important public purposes. 
The materials on record show that fees or consideration charged by them for the 
purposes provided are nominal . In the circumstances, it is held that the said two 
assessees are driven by charitable purposes. However , the claims of such non -
statutory organisations performing public functions, will have to be ascertained 
on a yearly basis, and the tax authorities must discern from the records, whether 
the fees charged are nominally above the cost, or have been increase d to much 
higher levels.  

E.2. It is held that though GS1 India  is in fact, involved in advancement of 
general public utility, its services are for the benefit of trade and business, from 
which they receive significantly high receipts. In the circumstances, its claim for 
exemption cannot succeed having regard to amend ed Section 2(15). However, 
the Court does not rule out any future claim made and being independently 
assessed, if GS1 is able to satisfy that what it provides to its customers is charged 
on cost -basis with at the most, a nominal markup.  
F. Sports associations  
So far as the state cricket associations are concerned (Saurashtra, Gujarat, 
Rajasthan, Baroda, and Rajkot), this Court is of the opinion that the matter 
requires further scrutiny , in light of the discussion in para graphs 228 -238  of the 
judgment . Accordi ngly, a direction is issued that the AO shall adjudicate the 
matter afresh after issuing notice to the concerned assessees and examining the 
relevant material indicated in the previous paragraphs of this judgment. 
Furthermore, if any consequential order ne eds to be issued, the same shall be done 
and resulting actions, including assessment orders shall be passed in accordance 
with the law under relevant provisions of the IT Act.  
G. Private Trusts  
So far as the appeal by assessee -Tribune Trust  is concerned, it h as been held that 
despite advancing general public utility, the Trust cannot benefit from exemption 
offered to entities covered by Section 2(15) as the records reveal that income 
received from advertisements, constituted business or commercial receipts. 
Consequently, the limit prescribed in the proviso to Section 2(15) has to be 
adhered to for the Trust’s claim of being as a charity eligible for exemption, to 
succeed.  Therefore, despite differing reasoning, this court has held that the 
impugned judgment of the High Court does not call for interference.  

H. Application of interpretation  
H. At the cost of repetition, it may be noted that the conclusions arrived at by 
way of this judgment, neither precludes any of the assessees (whether statutory, 
or non -statutory)  advancing objects of general public utility, from claiming 
exemption, nor the t axing authorities from denying exemption, in the future , if 
the receipts of the relevant year exceed the quantitative limit . The assessing 
authorities must on a yearly basis, scrutinize the record to discern whether the 
nature of the assessee’s activities amount to “trade, commerce or business” based 
on its receipts and income (i.e., whether the amounts charged are on cost -basis, 
or significantly higher). If it is found that they are in the nature of “trade, 
commerce or business”, then it must be examined w hether the quantified limit (as 
amended from time to time) in proviso to Section 2(15), has been breached, thus 
disentitling them to exemption.
